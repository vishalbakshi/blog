    "text": "Plan of Attack\nI’ll start by reviewing each step of the training loop covered in this chapter (for 3s and 7s) and identify what elements need to change, why, and an a brief outline of how, in order to accommodate for all 10 digits.\n\nLoad and Prep Data\nIn the chapter, we stacked tensor images of each digit to create n x 28 x 28 tensors (where n is the number of images in the training or validation folder) and then converted them to n x 784 tensors so that each pixel was in a one-dimensional row (corresponding to 784 parameters in the neural net in a one-dimensional row).\nTo handle all 10 digits, I’ll need to expand this logic without too much hard-coding—I don’t want to create 10 tensors individually (stacked_zeros, stacked_ones, …, stacked_tens) for training and validation data.\nInstead, I’ll use list comprehension. First, let’s look at how to access all the subfolders in the train and valid parent folders:\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n\npath = untar_data(URLs.MNIST)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.03% [15687680/15683414 00:00<00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing')]\n\n\n\nIndependent Variable: Images\nI can iterate through (path/'training').ls() to see the 10 digit subfolders containing training images for the digits:\n\n[path for path in (path/'training').ls()]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/8'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/6'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/3'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/2'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/4'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/7'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/5')]\n\n\nTaking it one layer deeper, I can nest a second list comprehension which collects individual file paths from each of the digit’s folders:\n\ntraining_files = [[file for file in path.ls()] for path in (path/'training').ls().sorted()]\n\nHere are the paths to the first 5 images in the first folder, which corresponds to the digit 0:\n\ntraining_files[0][:5]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0/35012.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0/2009.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0/14472.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0/7589.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/0/53401.png')]\n\n\nAnd the paths to the first 5 images in the second folder, which corresponds to the digit 1:\n\ntraining_files[1][:5]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1/47434.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1/27790.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1/42000.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1/15633.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/1/21958.png')]\n\n\nAnd so on for all 10 digits\n\ntraining_files[9][:5]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9/57008.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9/28984.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9/36162.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9/42013.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/training/9/18296.png')]\n\n\n\nlen(training_files)\n\n10\n\n\nI’ll illustrate the same for the validation set:\n\nvalidation_files = [[file for file in path.ls()] for path in (path/'testing').ls().sorted()]\n\n\nvalidation_files[0][:5]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/0/9095.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/0/5990.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/0/7505.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/0/157.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/0/5838.png')]\n\n\n\nvalidation_files[9][:5]\n\n[Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/9/2009.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/9/7298.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/9/5565.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/9/9483.png'),\n Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_png/testing/9/5705.png')]\n\n\n\nlen(validation_files)\n\n10\n\n\nNext, I’ll flatten the list of training and validation files, convert each to a stacked tensor, convert the pixel values to floating point values, and divide by 255 so the pixel values are between 0 and 1. I referenced this Stack Overflow post for flattening a nested list.\nTo understand how it works, I find it easier to read left-to-right, broken up into two separate parts:\nfile for (sublist in training_files) for (file in sublist)\nIn pseudocode:\npopulate this list with each file in each sublist in `training_files`\n\ntraining_files = [file for sublist in training_files for file in sublist]\nvalidation_files = [file for sublist in validation_files for file in sublist]\n\nThe dataset’s Wikimedia page says that it has 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This matches the counts here:\n\nlen(training_files), len(validation_files)\n\n(60000, 10000)\n\n\nI’ll open a couple of the files and make sure I can view the images as expected:\n\n# this should be an image of a handwritten zero\nshow_image(tensor(Image.open(training_files[0])));\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be an image of a handwritten nine\nshow_image(tensor(Image.open(training_files[-1])));\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be an image of a handwritten zero\nshow_image(tensor(Image.open(validation_files[0])));\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be an image of a handwritten nine\nshow_image(tensor(Image.open(validation_files[-1])));\n\n\n\n\nLooks good! The images are as expected. I can now move on to creating stacked floating point tensors of the training and validation images:\n\ntrain_x = torch.stack([tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in training_files]).float()/255\ntrain_x.shape\n\ntorch.Size([60000, 28, 28])\n\n\n\nvalid_x = torch.stack([tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in validation_files]).float()/255\nvalid_x.shape\n\ntorch.Size([10000, 28, 28])\n\n\nI’ll view my data one more time before changing its shape:\n\n# this should be a zero\nshow_image(train_x[0]);\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be a nine\nshow_image(train_x[-1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be a zero\nshow_image(valid_x[0]);\n\n\n\n\n\n# this should be a nine\nshow_image(valid_x[-1]);\n\n\n\n\nGreat! I’ll flatten the images so that they are 784 pixels long, instead of a 28 x 28 matrix.\n\ntrain_x = train_x.view(-1, 28*28)\ntrain_x.shape\n\ntorch.Size([60000, 784])\n\n\n\nvalid_x = valid_x.view(-1, 28*28)\nvalid_x.shape\n\ntorch.Size([10000, 784])\n\n\n\n\nDependent Variable: Labels\nNow that I have the x (independent) variable data prepared, I’ll do the same for the y (dependent) variable data—the labels for the images.\nI’ll reuse my training_files and validation_files lists as they already contain the paths to each image file, from which I’ll extract the label. path.parts splits the path into a tuple of its individual parts (split by “/”). The parent folder (the second-to-last part of the path) of the path is the label of the image.\n\ntraining_labels = [int(path.parts[-2]) for path in training_files]\ntraining_labels[0], training_labels[-1]\n\n(0, 9)\n\n\n\nvalidation_labels = [int(path.parts[-2]) for path in validation_files]\nvalidation_labels[0], validation_labels[-1]\n\n(0, 9)\n\n\n\ntrain_y = tensor(training_labels).unsqueeze(1)\ntrain_y.shape\n\ntorch.Size([60000, 1])\n\n\n\nvalid_y = tensor(validation_labels).unsqueeze(1)\nvalid_y.shape\n\ntorch.Size([10000, 1])\n\n\nExcellent! Now with the data in the right structure, I’ll create a DataLoaders object that will be fed to the learner during training:\n\ndset = list(zip(train_x, train_y))\nx,y = dset[0]\nx.shape, y\n\n(torch.Size([784]), tensor([0]))\n\n\n\nvalid_dset = list(zip(valid_x, valid_y))\nx,y = valid_dset[0]\nx.shape, y\n\n(torch.Size([784]), tensor([0]))\n\n\n\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nxb,yb = first(dl)\nxb.shape, yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([256, 784]), torch.Size([256, 1]))\n\n\n\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256)\nvalid_xb, valid_yb = first(valid_dl)\nvalid_xb.shape, valid_yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([256, 784]), torch.Size([256, 1]))\n\n\nI combine the two DataLoaders into a single DataLoaders object:\n\ndls = DataLoaders(dl, valid_dl)\n\nAnd check that they contain the right amount of data:\n\nlen(dls.train.dataset), len(dls.valid.dataset)\n\n(60000, 10000)\n\n\nGreat! With my DataLoaders prepared, I can move on to other aspects of the training loop that will need to be modified to handle 10 digits instead of 2.\n\n\n\nCreate Our Model\nHere is the existing model that we’re using to classify two digits:\nsimple_net = nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Linear(28*28, 30),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.Linear(30, 1)\n)\nIt has 784 inputs and 1 output. For 10 digits, I need to adjust th number of outputs to 10:\n\nsimple_net = nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Linear(28*28, 30),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.Linear(30,10)\n)\n\nI assume that since we have more final activations, we would also need to increase the intermediate activations from 30 to a larger number, but I’ll keep it at 30 for now and then make improvements once I’ve actually got a successful training loop.\n\n\nCreate a Loss Function\nThis is the main change that will take place in our training loop: using a loss function that can handle 10 digits instead of 2. In the exercise prompt, they said that we would need to:\n\ndo some of your own research to figure out how to overcome obstacles you’ll meet on the way\n\nAnd I think this is probably the main obstacle to overcome. In the textbook chapter, when they trained the dataset using the built-in Learner, they passed it F.cross_entropy as the loss function:\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=False, loss_func=F.cross_entropy, metrics=accuracy)\n\nIn the text, they introduce Cross-Entropy Loss in Chapter 5, so I’ll take a detour through that chapter’s relevant sections to inform me on how to create a loss function for a 10-digit classifier.\n\nCross-Entropy Loss\n\nWorks even when our dependent variable has more than two categories.\nResults in faster and more reliable training.\n\nAs is done in the book example, I’ll view one batch of our data:\n\nx,y = dls.one_batch()\ny[:10]\n\ntensor([[0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0],\n        [0]])\n\n\nCurrently, my data is not shuffled, so all the 0s are first, then all the 1s, 2s, …, and 9s. This doesn’t seem like a great way to train the model since it will learn only 1 digit’s features in each batch. I’ll recreate the DataLoaders and pass the parameter value shuffle=True:\n\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)\nxb,yb = first(dl)\nyb[:10]\n\ntensor([[5],\n        [4],\n        [1],\n        [3],\n        [0],\n        [3],\n        [7],\n        [2],\n        [3],\n        [0]])\n\n\n\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)\nvalid_xb, valid_yb = first(valid_dl)\nvalid_yb[:10]\n\ntensor([[4],\n        [7],\n        [9],\n        [6],\n        [1],\n        [8],\n        [9],\n        [5],\n        [3],\n        [0]])\n\n\n\ndls = DataLoaders(dl, valid_dl)\n\n\nlen(dls.train.dataset), len(dls.valid.dataset)\n\n(60000, 10000)\n\n\nNow, when I look at one batch, I can see a variety of labels:\n\nx,y = dls.one_batch()\ny[:10]\n\ntensor([[8],\n        [3],\n        [2],\n        [7],\n        [3],\n        [9],\n        [1],\n        [6],\n        [0],\n        [7]])\n\n\nThe output predictions of the model will contain 10 predictions (one for each digit) that add up to 1. According to Chapter 5, we need to use the softmax function to achieve a result like this.\n\nSoftmax\nAssume we have a scenario with 6 images and 2 possible categories (3 and 7):\n\ntorch.random.manual_seed(42);\n\n\nacts = torch.randn((6,2))*2\nacts\n\ntensor([[ 0.6734,  0.2576],\n        [ 0.4689,  0.4607],\n        [-2.2457, -0.3727],\n        [ 4.4164, -1.2760],\n        [ 0.9233,  0.5347],\n        [ 1.0698,  1.6187]])\n\n\nWe can’t just take the sigmoid of this directly since we want rows to add up to 1.0 (i.e., we want the probability of being a 3 plus the probability of being a 7 to add up to 1).\n\nacts.sigmoid()\n\ntensor([[0.6623, 0.5641],\n        [0.6151, 0.6132],\n        [0.0957, 0.4079],\n        [0.9881, 0.2182],\n        [0.7157, 0.6306],\n        [0.7446, 0.8346]])\n\n\nIn the binary case, a single pair of activations simply indicates the relative confidence of the input being a 3 versus being a 7. The overall values, whether they are both high or both low, don’t matter—all that matters is which is higher and by how much.\nWe can take the difference between the neural net activations because that reflects how much more sure we are of the input being a 3 than a 7, and then take the sigmoid of that:\n\n(acts[:,0] - acts[:,1]).sigmoid()\n\ntensor([0.6025, 0.5021, 0.1332, 0.9966, 0.5959, 0.3661])\n\n\nThe second column (the probability of it being a 7) will then just be that value subtracted from 1. The function softmax does this for any number of columns:\n\ndef softmax(x): return torch.exp(x) / torch.exp(x).sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n\nsm_acts = softmax(acts)\nsm_acts\n\ntensor([[0.6025, 0.3975],\n        [0.5021, 0.4979],\n        [0.1332, 0.8668],\n        [0.9966, 0.0034],\n        [0.5959, 0.4041],\n        [0.3661, 0.6339]])\n\n\nsoftmax is the multi-category equivalent of sigmoid. We have to use it any time we have more than two categories and the probabilities of the categories must add up to 1. Taking the exponential ensures all of our numbers are positive, and then dividing by the sum ensures that we are going to have a bunch of numbers that add up to 1.\nsoftmax is the first part of the cross-entropy loss, the second part is log likelihood.\n\n\nLog Likelihood\nWhen we calculated the loss for our MNIST example, we used:\ndef mnist_loss(inputs, targets):\n  inputs = inputs.sigmoid()\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-inputs, inputs).mean()\nWe need to extend the loss function to work with more than just binary classification.\nOur activations after softmax are between 0 and 1, and sum to 1 for each row in the batch of predictions, our targets are integers between 0 and 9.\nLet’s say these are our labels:\n\ntarg = tensor([0,1,0,1,1,0])\n\nAnd these are the softmax activations:\n\nsm_acts\n\ntensor([[0.6025, 0.3975],\n        [0.5021, 0.4979],\n        [0.1332, 0.8668],\n        [0.9966, 0.0034],\n        [0.5959, 0.4041],\n        [0.3661, 0.6339]])\n\n\nThen for each item of targ, we can use that to select the appropriate column of sm_acts using tensor indexing like this:\n\nidx = range(6)\nsm_acts[idx, targ]\n\ntensor([0.6025, 0.4979, 0.1332, 0.0034, 0.4041, 0.3661])\n\n\nAs long as the activation columns sum to 1 (as they will if we use softmax), we’ll have a loss function that shows how well we’re predicting each digit.\nMaking the activation for the correct label as high as possible must mean we’re also decreasing the activations of the remaining columns.\nPyTorch provides nll_loss which does the same thing as sm_acts[range(n), targ] except it takes the negative because when applying log afterwards we want negative numbers:\n\n-sm_acts[idx, targ]\n\ntensor([-0.6025, -0.4979, -0.1332, -0.0034, -0.4041, -0.3661])\n\n\n\nF.nll_loss(sm_acts, targ, reduction='none')\n\ntensor([-0.6025, -0.4979, -0.1332, -0.0034, -0.4041, -0.3661])\n\n\n\n\nTaking the log\nHere’s a plot of the log function\n\ndef plot_function(f, title=None, min=-2.1, max=2.1, color='r', ylim=None):\n    x = torch.linspace(min,max, 100)[:,None]\n    if ylim: plt.ylim(ylim)\n    plt.plot(x, f(x), color)\n    if title is not None: plt.title(title)\n\n\nplot_function(torch.log, min=0, max=4)\n\n\n\n\nWe want to transform our probabilities to larger values so we can perform mathematical operations on them. We also want our model to learn the difference between 0.99 and 0.999 (the latter is 10 times more confident). We can use the logarithm function to transform our numbers between 0 and 1 to instead be between negative infinity and positive infinity.\nApplying negative log to the softmax output:\n\ntarg\n\ntensor([0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0])\n\n\n\nsm_acts\n\ntensor([[0.6025, 0.3975],\n        [0.5021, 0.4979],\n        [0.1332, 0.8668],\n        [0.9966, 0.0034],\n        [0.5959, 0.4041],\n        [0.3661, 0.6339]])\n\n\n\nsm_acts[idx, targ]\n\ntensor([0.6025, 0.4979, 0.1332, 0.0034, 0.4041, 0.3661])\n\n\n\n-torch.log(sm_acts[idx, targ])\n\ntensor([0.5067, 0.6973, 2.0160, 5.6958, 0.9062, 1.0048])\n\n\nThe loss is larger for incorrect predictions (2.0160 for the third image with activations of 0.1332 for 3—the target value—and 0.8668 for 7) and for unconfident correct predictions (5.6958 for the fourth image with activations of 0.9966 for 3 and 0.0034 for 7—the target value).\nPyTorch provides the nn.CrossEntropyLoss class and the F.cross_entropy function:\n\nF.cross_entropy(acts, targ, reduction='none')\n\ntensor([0.5067, 0.6973, 2.0160, 5.6958, 0.9062, 1.0048])\n\n\n\nnn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none')(acts, targ)\n\ntensor([0.5067, 0.6973, 2.0160, 5.6958, 0.9062, 1.0048])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Function to Calculate Predictions, Loss and Gradients\nIn this section, the text has the following function to calculate predictions, loss and gradients:\ndef calc_grad(xb, yb, model):\n  preds = model(xb)\n  loss = mnist_loss(preds, yb)\n  loss.backward()\nI don’t think anything needs to be changed here. In my implementation of a BasicLearner I have generalized that function as:\ndef calc_grad(self, xb, yb, model):\n    preds = self.model(xb)\n    loss = self.loss_func(preds, yb)\n    loss.backward()\nI believe that should work fine with nn.CrossEntropyLoss() as the function assigned to my self.loss_func parameter.\n\n\nCreate an Optimizer\nThe optimizer’s functionality (stepping the parameters and setting the gradients to zero) will not need to be changed to handle 10 digits.\n\n\nCreate a Function to Train One Epoch\nThe steps needed to train an epoch will not need to be changed to handle 10 digits:\ndef train_epoch(model):\n  for xb,yb in dl:\n    calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n    opt.step()\n    opt.zero_grad()\n\n\nCreate a Function to Calculate a Metric for One Batch\nAlong with the loss function, this is the second big change when dealing with 10 digits instead of 2. Currently, in text, we use a batch_accuracy function as the metric during training:\ndef batch_accuracy(xb, yb):\n  preds = xb.sigmoid()\n  correct = (preds>0.5) == yb\n  return correct.float().mean()\nFor each batch the following steps take place in calculating accuracy:\n\nCalculate the sigmoid value of the predictions.\nDetermine which predictions are greater than 0.5 and if they are, whether they are correctly labeled as 3s.\nReturn the mean value of the previous tensor, which will calculate as number of correct predictions / number of total predictions.\n\nTo understand how to calculate accuracy for a dataset with 10 digits, I’ll create an example calculation similar to what they did in chapter 5 for illustrating the softmax/log likelihood example.

    "text": "What is Collaborative Filtering?\nIn a situation where two variables have some numeric relationship, such as users rating movies, collaborative filtering is a solution for predicting ratings that are blank, based on existing data.\nA machine learning model for collaborative filtering implicitly learns the answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat types of movies do users like?\nWhat are characteristics of each movie?\n\n\nLatent Factors\nFor the movie rating example, latent factors are the “types of movies” users like and “characteristics” of each movie. Latent factors are not explicitly categorical, they are numeric values, but they represent the implicit categories of each variable.\nThe reason that they are implicit categories, is that the model learns the ideal latent factors as it trains on the dataset, observing patterns between users and their movie ratings."

There are 943 unique users and 1682 unique movies.\n\n# how many unique users and movies are there?\nlen(ratings['user'].unique()), len(ratings['movie'].unique())\n\n(943, 1682)\n\n\nThe movie IDs are a consecutive range from 1 to 1682 and the user IDs are a consecutive range from 1 to 943. The movie ratings range from 1 to 5.\n\n# are movie IDs consecutive?\n(ratings['movie'].sort_values().unique() == np.array(range(1,1683))).sum()\n\n1682\n\n\n\n# are user IDs consecutive?\n(ratings['user'].sort_values().unique() == np.array(range(1,944))).sum()\n\n943\n\n\n\n# what is the range of ratings?\nratings['rating'].min(), ratings['rating'].max()\n\n(1, 5)\n\n\nTo visualize the problem we are trying to solve with collaborative filtering the book recommended that we observe a cross-tabulation of the data because then we can see that what we are trying to predict are the null values between user and movie, and what we are training our model on are the non-null ratings in the dataset.\nThe model will learn something about user 2 and movie 2 in order to predict what rating that user would give that movie. That “something” the model will learn are the latent factors for users and latent factors for movies.\n\n# view crosstab of users and movies with rating values\nct = pd.crosstab(ratings['user'], ratings['movie'], ratings['rating'],aggfunc='mean')\nct\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      movie\n      1\n      2\n      3\n      4\n      5\n      6\n      7\n      8\n      9\n      10\n      11\n

And we need to give the model something concrete and numeric to represent those relationships. We will give it latent factor matrices.\nIn this example, they have chosen to use 5 latent factors for movies and 5 latent factors for users. We represent these latent factors by creating a matrix of random values.\nThe user latent factors will have 944 rows, one for each user including a null user, and 5 columns, one for each latent factor. The movies latent factors will have 1665, one for each movie including a null movie, and 5 columns.\n\n# user and title classes contain '#na#'\nL(dls.classes['title']),L(dls.classes['user'])\n\n((#1665) ['#na#',\"'Til There Was You (1997)\",'1-900 (1994)','101 Dalmatians (1996)','12 Angry Men (1957)','187 (1997)','2 Days in the Valley (1996)','20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954)','2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)','3 Ninjas: High Noon At Mega Mountain (1998)'...],\n (#944) ['#na#',1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...])\n\n\n\n# define dimensions for users and movies latent factor matrices\nn_users = len(dls.classes['user'])\nn_movies = len(dls.classes['title'])\nn_factors = 5\nn_users, n_movies, n_factors\n\n(944, 1665, 5)\n\n\n\n# build users and movies latent factor matrices\nuser_factors = torch.randn(n_users,n_factors)\nmovie_factors = torch.randn(n_movies, n_factors)\nuser_factors.shape, movie_factors.shape\n\n(torch.Size([944, 5]), torch.Size([1665, 5]))\n\n\n\n\nEmbeddings instead of One Hot Encoded Matrix Multiplication\nOkay so how do we use these latent factor matrices?\nFor each row in our batch, we have a user ID and a movie ID. We need to get the latent factors for each of those and calculate the dot product, in order to predict our rating. As it adjusts the latent factors during the training loop, the predictions will get better.\nI’ll grab one batch from the dls DataLoaders object and illustrate an example prediction calculation. Each independent variable, x, is a tensor with [user, movie]. Each dependent variable, y, is a tensor with [rating].\n\nx,y = dls.one_batch()\nx.shape, y.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 2]), torch.Size([64, 1]))\n\n\n\nx[0], y[0]\n\n(tensor([466, 614]), tensor([3], dtype=torch.int8))\n\n\n\ntype(x[0]), type(y[0])\n\n(torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor)\n\n\nI determined the order of the x values by looking at the maximum value in each column, specifying axis=0. The movie IDs go up to 1644, so a max value of 1608 means that the movie is the second value in each tensor.\n\nx.max(axis=0)\n\ntorch.return_types.max(values=tensor([ 935, 1642]), indices=tensor([24,  3]))\n\n\nI get the latent factors for the user and movie in the first batch item.\n\nu = user_factors[x[0][0]]\nu\n\ntensor([-0.6595, -0.3355,  1.0491,  1.1764,  0.8750])\n\n\n\nm = movie_factors[x[0][1]]\nm\n\ntensor([-0.1751, -0.5016,  0.6298,  0.2370, -0.7902])\n\n\nI calculate the dot product of the two vectors, which is the sum of the element-wise product.\n\npred = (u * m).sum()\npred\n\ntensor(0.5320)\n\n\nI pass it through sigmoid_range to get a value between 0 and 5. Sigmoid outputs a value between 0 and 1, and sigmoid_range scales and shifts that function to fit the specified range. The output is the prediction for the rating that this user would give this movie.\n\npred = sigmoid_range(pred, 0, 5)\npred\n\ntensor(3.1497)\n\n\nSince the prediction and the target are a single numeric value, we’ll use Mean Squared Error loss. For a single value, the loss is the squared error. For a batch, the mean would be calculated.\n\nloss = (pred - y[0].item()) ** 2\nloss\n\ntensor(0.0224)\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a Collaborative Filtering Model from Scratch\nI’ll create a DotProduct class which builds an Embedding to store latent factor matrices for users and movies, and calculates the prediction in its forward method using the dot product of the user and movie latent factors.\n\nclass DotProduct(Module):\n  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors, y_range=(0,5.5)):\n    self.user_factors = Embedding(n_users, n_factors)\n    self.movie_factors = Embedding(n_movies, n_factors)\n    self.y_range = y_range\n\n  def forward(self, x):\n    users = self.user_factors(x[:,0])\n    movies = self.movie_factors(x[:,1])\n    return sigmoid_range((users * movies).sum(dim=1), *self.y_range)\n\nI’ll illustrate how this model operates by coding through the calculation of predictions for one batch.\nI create Embeddings for users and movies. Their shape corresponds to the number of users and movies and the number of latent factors.\n\nuser_factors = Embedding(n_users, n_factors)\nmovie_factors = Embedding(n_movies, n_factors)\nuser_factors, movie_factors\n\n(Embedding(944, 5), Embedding(1665, 5))\n\n\nThe weight attribute holds the latent factor values, which are parameters whose gradient can be calculated.

Instead, I will get a value that is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of 1. Model 2 will pass the predictions through sigmoid_range to get an output between 0 and 5.5. Model 3 will add a bias parameter to the dot product prediction, so that we can establish some baseline rating of each movie that’s independent of a particular latent factor. Model 4 will introduce weight decay in order to better generalize our model, and in Model 5 I’ll implement a custom class instead of using the built-in PyTorch Embedding class.\n\n\n\nModel\nsigmoid_range\nBias\nWeight Decay\nCustom Embedding\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\nN\nN\nN\n\n\n2\nY\nN\nN\nN\n\n\n3\nY\nY\nN\nN\n\n\n4\nY\nY\nY\nN\n\n\n5\nY\nY\nY\nY\n\n\n\n\nModel 1: No sigmoid_range\nThe DotProduct class will initialize an Embedding for users and movies with random values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.

The book recommends, based on what they’ve experienced, using a maximum rating for predictions that is slightly larger than the maximum ground truth rating.

In fact, the valid loss starts to increase at the end. This is an indication that overfitting is taking place. This will be addressed in Model 4.\n\n\nModel 3 - Add bias\nBut first, let’s look at Model 3, which adds a bias parameter to the predictions, which provides a baseline rating for each movie independent of the weights related to the different latent factors.\n\nclass DotProductBias(Module):\n  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors, y_range=(0,5.5)):\n    self.user_factors = Embedding(n_users, n_factors)\n    self.user_bias = Embedding(n_users, 1)\n    self.movie_factors = Embedding(n_movies, n_factors)\n    self.movie_bias = Embedding(n_movies, 1)\n    self.y_range = y_range\n  \n  def forward(self, x):\n    users = self.user_factors(x[:,0])\n    movies = self.movie_factors(x[:,1])\n    res = (users * movies).sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    res += self.user_bias(x[:,0]) + self.movie_bias(x[:,1])\n    return sigmoid_range(res, *self.y_range)\n\nIn addition to initializing new Embeddings for bias, the dot product is first kept in matrix form by passing keepdim=True to the sum method. The biases are then added on afterwhich the result is passed through sigmoid_range. Here’s a illustrative example for how keepdim=True affects the dot product:\n\na = Tensor([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])\n(a * a).sum(dim=1).shape, (a * a).sum(dim=1, keepdim=True).shape\n\n(torch.Size([2]), torch.Size([2, 1]))\n\n\nThe first tensor is a 2-vector, whereas the second tensor is a 2 x 1 matrix.\n\nLet’s train Model 3 and view the results!\n\nmodel = DotProductBias(n_users, n_movies, 50)\nlearn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=MSELossFlat())\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5,5e-3)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.952214\n      0.912603\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.825348\n      0.845193\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.618910\n      0.852381\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.406514\n      0.875637\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.293729\n      0.882840\n      00:07\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThe initial validation loss is lower than the previous trainings, but Model 3 is overfitting even more than Model 2. It’s time to introduce weight decay.\n\n\nModel 4 - Use Weight Decay\nSmaller weights lead to a smoother function which corresponds to fewer inflection points, leading to a better generalization of the model. Larger weights lead to a sharper function, corresponding to more inflection points which overfit the training data.\nThe text uses the basic example of a parabola to illustrate. As the weight a increases, the function becomes narrower, with a sharper trough.\n\nHTML('<iframe src=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/uog6rvyubg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" frameborder=0></iframe>')\n\n\n\n\nWe will intentionally increase the gradients so that the weights are stepped with larger increments toward a smaller value.\nThis corresponds to an intentionally larger loss value calculated for each batch:\nloss_with_wd = loss + wd * (parameters**2).sum()\nThe parameters are squared to ensure a positive value. Taking the derivative of the loss function means taking the derivative of the following function:\nwd * (parameters**2).sum()\nWhich results in:\n2 * wd * parameters\nInstead of multiplying by 2, we can just use twice the weight decay value as wd. I’ll use a weight decay of 0.1 as they do in the text.\n\nmodel = DotProductBias(n_users, n_movies, 50)\nlearn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=MSELossFlat())\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5,5e-3, wd=0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.939321\n      0.937423\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.851871\n      0.855584\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.720202\n      0.815807\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.630149\n      0.806268\n      00:07\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.491224\n      0.807063\n      00:07\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nlearn.show_results()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      user\n      title\n      rating\n      rating_pred\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      877\n      1538\n      3\n      3.708797\n    \n    \n      1\n      601\n      1285\n      1\n      2.832736\n    \n    \n      2\n      292\n      1147\n      2\n      3.675529\n    \n    \n      3\n      132\n      400\n      4\n      3.504542\n    \n    \n      4\n      405\n      1614\n      1\n      1.930779\n    \n    \n      5\n      655\n      458\n      3\n      3.274209\n    \n    \n      6\n      453\n      60\n      4\n      3.864617\n    \n    \n      7\n      629\n      1498\n      4\n      3.598821\n    \n    \n      8\n      724\n      580\n      4\n      3.921505\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nModel 5 - custom Embedding class\nThe final model I’ll train does not have a fundamentally different component than the other four. Instead of using the built-in Embedding PyTorch class, the text has us write our own class.\nOptimizers get a module’s parameters by calling the parameters method. We have to wrap parameters in nn.Parameter for them to be recognized as such. This class also calls requires_grad_ for us.\nI’ll replace each Embedding with a tensor filled with random values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.01.\n\ndef create_params(size):\n  return nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(*size).normal_(0,0.01))\n\n\ntorch.zeros(3,4)\n\ntensor([[0., 0., 0., 0.],\n        [0., 0., 0., 0.],\n        [0., 0., 0., 0.]])\n\n\n\ntorch.zeros(3,4).normal_(0,0.01)\n\ntensor([[-0.0134,  0.0098, -0.0124, -0.0032],\n        [ 0.0056,  0.0071,  0.0005,  0.0014],\n        [-0.0236, -0.0024, -0.0060,  0.0017]])\n\n\nI redefine the DotProductBias model using the create_params method instead of Embedding, and train the model.italicized text\n\nclass DotProductBias(Module):\n  def __init__(self, n_users, n_movies, n_factors, y_range=(0,5.5)):\n    self.user_factors = create_params([n_users, n_factors])\n    self.user_bias = create_params([n_users])\n    self.movie_factors = create_params([n_movies, n_factors])\n    self.movie_bias = create_params([n_movies])\n    self.y_range = y_range\n  \n  def forward(self, x):\n    users = self.user_factors[x[:,0]]\n    movies = self.movie_factors[x[:,1]]\n    res = (users * movies).sum(dim=1)\n    res += self.user_bias[x[:,0]] + self.movie_bias[x[:,1]]\n    return sigmoid_range(res, *self.y_range)\n\n\nmodel = DotProductBias(n_users, n_movies, 50)\nlearn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=MSELossFlat())\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5,5e-3, wd=0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.934845\n      0.933218\n      00:08\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.841111\n      0.859618\n      00:08\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.730065\n      0.820388\n      00:08\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.599684\n      0.807086\n      00:08\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.484760\n      0.807552\n      00:08\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nlearn.show_results()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      user\n      title\n      rating\n      rating_pred\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      487\n      6\n      3\n      2.994869\n    \n    \n      1\n      54\n      349\n      3\n      2.511689\n    \n    \n      2\n      501\n      1252\n      4\n      4.130728\n    \n    \n      3\n      244\n      861\n      4\n      2.314526\n    \n    \n      4\n      322\n      1501\n      5\n      3.823119\n    \n    \n      5\n      537\n      1294\n      2\n      3.124064\n    \n    \n      6\n      193\n      1530\n      3\n      2.546681\n    \n    \n      7\n      581\n      286\n      5\n      3.062707\n    \n    \n      8\n      450\n      154\n      4\n      4.161049\n    \n  \n\n\n\nI get similar results as before!\n\n\n\nInterpreting Embeddings and Biases\nI’ll save this model so that the embedding and bias analyses I perform can be recreated.\n\nlearn = load_learner(\"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/fastai-course-v4/dot_product_bias.pkl\")\nmodel = learn.model\n\nBias represents a baseline rating of a movie regardless of how well the latent factors of the movie match the latent factors of the user. Low bias values correspond to movies that people didn’t enjoy, even if it matched their preferences.\nWhat were the 5 generally least liked movies?\nTo answer that question, I get the indexes of the sorted movie_bias values in ascending order, grab the first 5, and get their title from the DataLoaders classes.

I’ll use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the two most descriptive dimensions and plot the latent factor values. I’ll also calculate the distance from 0 of each movie so that I can filter for outliers in order to reduce the number of data points on the plot, and help me understand what these latent factors may be.\n\n!pip install fbpca\nimport fbpca\n\nCollecting fbpca\n  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a7/a5/2085d0645a4bb4f0b606251b0b7466c61326e4a471d445c1c3761a2d07bc/fbpca-1.0.tar.gz\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: fbpca\n  Building wheel for fbpca (setup.py) ... done\n  Created wheel for fbpca: filename=fbpca-1.0-cp37-none-any.whl size=11376 sha256=719b80446eeb8f157c99e298adb61b0978c0ae279ade82e500dbe37902c447e4\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/53/a2/dd/9b66cf53dbc58cec1e613d216689e5fa946d3e7805c30f60dc\nSuccessfully built fbpca\nInstalling collected packages: fbpca\nSuccessfully installed fbpca-1.0\n\n\nI grab the movie_factors from the trained model, bring it over the the .cpu(), .detach() it from the gradients and convert it to a .numpy() array.\n\nmovie_embeddings = model.movie_factors.cpu().detach().numpy()\n\nI pass those embeddings to the fbpca.pca method and get back the rank-2 approximation.\n\nU, s, Va = fbpca.pca(movie_embeddings, k=2)\n\nI then create a DataFrame from the U matrix which is an m x k (1665 movies x 2 components) matrix.

I haven’t seen all of these movies, but Dirty Dancing and The American President seem like anomalies in this group.\nI should also take a look at other movies that do not fall on the extreme ends of each quadrant. For example, which movies fall close to the vertical and horizontal axes?\n\ndef plot_close_to_axes(df):\n  # get 5 points closes to each axis \n  idxs = np.array([])\n  for key in ['0', '1']:\n    idxs = np.append(idxs, df[np.abs(df[key]) < 0.0002].index.values)\n  plot_df = df.loc[idxs]\n  plot_df = plot_df.drop_duplicates()\n\n  # set figure size\n  %matplotlib inline\n  plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [15, 15]\n\n  # get the movie titles which will be plot annotations\n  movies = dls.classes['title'][idxs]\n\n  fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n  ax.scatter(plot_df['0'], plot_df['1'])\n\n  # annotate with movie titles\n  for i, idx in enumerate(idxs):\n    ax.annotate(movies[i], (plot_df.loc[idx,'0'], plot_df.loc[idx, '1']))\n\n  plt.show()\n\n\nplot_close_to_axes(df)\n\n\n\n\nThe latent factor corresponding to the vertical axis seems to represent drama (positive values) and romance (negative values) whereas the horizontal axis represents elements mystery (negative values) and comedy (positive values). However, I could just be focusing on genre whereas there are other features of a movie these may represent. Unfortunately, I’m not a movie buff, so the need for a domain expert is evident here!\n\n\nRobust PCA\nAlthough it’s out of scope for this chapter and my understanding, I’d like to at least experiment with using Robust PCA for visualizing embeddings. Robust PCA is an algorithm which decomposes a matrix M into two components: a low rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S such that M = L + S. From what I understand, the sparse matrix S contains anomalies or outliers or “corrupted” data, whereas L contains a more accurate representation of the original data. For example, if an image has some additional noise added to it, the original image matrix M can be decomposed into a noise-less “clean” image L and a sparse noise matrix S. Another example is if you have an image with a background (such as a landscape with lawn, sidewalks, buildings) and a foreground (people walking on the sidewalk) passing that image through the RPCA algorithm would yield a background matrix L with the lawn, sidewalk and buildings and a foreground sparse matrix S with the people. Since my movie_embeddings matrix may contain anomalies which would affect the effectiveness and accuracy of my 2-component PCA approximation, I will pass it through a RPCA algorithm and calculate the 2-component approximation on the low-rank L and sparse S matrices and compare the results with what I calculated above.\nThe following algorithm is from Rachel Thomas’ lesson on RPCA as part of her Computational Linear Algebra course.\n\nfrom scipy import sparse\nfrom sklearn.utils.extmath import randomized_svd\nimport fbpca\n\n\nTOL=1e-9\nMAX_ITERS=3\n\n\ndef converged(Z, d_norm):\n    err = np.linalg.norm(Z, 'fro') / d_norm\n    print('error: ', err)\n    return err < TOL\n\n\ndef shrink(M, tau):\n    S = np.abs(M) - tau\n    return np.sign(M) * np.where(S>0, S, 0)\n\n\ndef _svd(M, rank): return fbpca.pca(M, k=min(rank, np.min(M.shape)), raw=True)\n\n\ndef norm_op(M): return _svd(M, 1)[1][0]\n\n\ndef svd_reconstruct(M, rank, min_sv):\n    u, s, v = _svd(M, rank)\n    s -= min_sv\n    nnz = (s > 0).sum()\n    return u[:,:nnz] @ np.diag(s[:nnz]) @ v[:nnz], nnz\n\n\ndef pcp(X, maxiter=10, k=10): # refactored\n    m, n = X.shape\n    trans = m<n\n    if trans: X = X.T; m, n = X.shape\n        \n    lamda = 1/np.sqrt(m)\n    op_norm = norm_op(X)\n    Y = np.copy(X) / max(op_norm, np.linalg.norm( X, np.inf) / lamda)\n    mu = k*1.25/op_norm; mu_bar = mu * 1e7; rho = k * 1.5\n    \n    d_norm = np.linalg.norm(X, 'fro')\n    L = np.zeros_like(X); sv = 1\n    \n    examples = []\n    \n    for i in range(maxiter):\n        print(\"rank sv:\", sv)\n        X2 = X + Y/mu\n        \n        # update estimate of Sparse Matrix by \"shrinking/truncating\": original - low-rank\n        S = shrink(X2 - L, lamda/mu)\n        \n        # update estimate of Low-rank Matrix by doing truncated SVD of rank sv & reconstructing.\n        # count of singular values > 1/mu is returned as svp\n        L, svp = svd_reconstruct(X2 - S, sv, 1/mu)\n        \n        # If svp < sv, you are already calculating enough singular values.\n        # If not, add 20% (in this case 240) to sv\n        sv = svp + (1 if svp < sv else round(0.05*n))\n        \n        # residual\n        Z = X - L - S\n        Y += mu*Z; mu *= rho\n        \n        examples.extend([S[140,:], L[140,:]])\n        \n        if m > mu_bar: m = mu_bar\n        if converged(Z, d_norm): break\n    \n    if trans: L=L.T; S=S.T\n    return L, S, examples\n\n\nL, S, examples = pcp(movie_embeddings)\n\n\nL.shape, S.shape\n\nI’ll calculate 2-component PCA for the L and S matrices and plot those to see how they compare to the plots above.\n\nU_L, _, _ = fbpca.pca(L, k=2)\nU_S, _, _ = fbpca.pca(S, k=2)\n\nI exported the outputs to CSV for repeatability, so I’ll import them in again:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/fastai-course-v4/movies_L_pca.csv\")\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      0\n      1\n      2\n      3\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.009254\n      -0.003454\n      0.009877\n      Fourth Quadrant\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.032954\n      0.008637\n      0.034067\n      First Quadrant\n    \n    \n      2\n      -0.014662\n      -0.047128\n      0.049356\n      Third Quadrant\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.012602\n      0.029182\n      0.031787\n      First Quadrant\n    \n    \n      4\n      -0.037841\n      0.008742\n      0.038838\n      Second Quadrant\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nplt.scatter(df['0'], df['1'])\n\n<matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x7f06668a58d0>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot for the 2-component PCA result seems much more evenly distributed across the quadrants.\nI take the 5 farthest movies from each quadrant and plot those separately.\n\nplot_top_5(df)\n\n\n\n\nHere are the patterns I observe.

Similar movies are grouped together but the latent factors are showing an inverse relationship to the original 2-components.\n\n\n\nUsing fastai.collab\nfastai comes with a built-in method to create a collaborative filtering model similar to the DotProductBias model I created.\n\nlearn = collab_learner(dls, n_factors=50, y_range=(0, 5.5))\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-3, wd=0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.932735\n      0.930009\n      00:10\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.834800\n      0.862961\n      00:11\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.746893\n      0.822192\n      00:10\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.585107\n      0.811398\n      00:10\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.490022\n      0.812597\n      00:10\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThis yields similar results to what I’ve done above.

Confidential (1997)',\n 'Star Wars (1977)',\n \"Schindler's List (1993)\"]\n\n\nSimilar to the distance function I created, PyTorch has a nn.CosineSimilarity function which calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The smaller the angle, the closer the two points are, and the more similar they are. nn.CosineSimilarity returns the similarity (cosine of the angle) between two vectors where 1.000 means the angle is 0.\n\nmovie_factors = learn.model.i_weight.weight\nidx = dls.classes['title'].o2i['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)']\nsimilarity = nn.CosineSimilarity(dim=1)(movie_factors, movie_factors[idx][None])\nidx = similarity.argsort(descending=True)[1]\ndls.classes['title'][idx]\n\n'Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade (1993)'\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning for Collaborative Filtering\nIn this final section, we create a Deep Learning model which can make predictions on movie ratings after training on the MovieLens dataset. The model uses Embeddings (for users and movies) which are then fed into a small neural net (with one ReLu sandwiched between two Linear layers) which outputs an activation which we normalize using sigmoid_range. The embedding matrices are sized based on a heuristic built-in to fastai with the get_emb_sz method:\n\nembs = get_emb_sz(dls)\nembs\n\n[(944, 74), (1665, 102)]\n\n\nThe model used is constructed as follows: the user and item latent factors are created using Embeddings, and the neural net is created using the nn.Sequential class. Each time a prediction is needed, the user and item matrices for one batch are concatenated and passed through the neural net. The returned activation is sent to sigmoid_range and a prediction between 0 and 5.5 is calculated.\n\nclass CollabNN(Module):\n  def __init__(self, user_sz, item_sz, y_range=(0, 5.5), n_act=100):\n    self.user_factors = Embedding(*user_sz)\n    self.item_factors = Embedding(*item_sz)\n    self.layers = nn.Sequential(\n        nn.Linear(user_sz[1]+item_sz[1], n_act),\n        nn.ReLU(),\n        nn.Linear(n_act, 1))\n    self.y_range = y_range\n\n  def forward(self, x):\n    embs = self.user_factors(x[:,0]), self.item_factors(x[:,1])\n    x = self.layers(torch.cat(embs, dim=1))\n    return sigmoid_range(x, *self.y_range)\n\nI want to visualize the forward method, so I’ll create the model and a batch, and walkthrough the code.\n\nmodel = CollabNN(*embs)\nx,y = dls.one_batch()\ndevice = \"cpu\"\nx = x.to(device)\nmodel = model.to(device)\nembs = torch.cat((model.user_factors(x[:,0]), model.item_factors(x[:,1])), dim=1)\nembs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 176])\n\n\n\nx = model.layers(embs)\nsigmoid_range(x, *model.y_range)[:5]\n\ntensor([[2.8637],\n        [2.8647],\n        [2.8624],\n        [2.8696],\n        [2.8601]], grad_fn=<SliceBackward>)\n\n\nThe fastai collab_learner, instead of using the EmbeddingDotBias model, will use a neural network if passed True for its use_nn parameter. The number and size of neural network layers can also be specified.\n\nlearn = collab_learner(dls, use_nn=True, y_range=(0, 5.5), layers=[100,50])\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(5, 5e-3, wd=0.1)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.988426\n      0.984418\n      00:15\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.893442\n      0.909180\n      00:16\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.900106\n      0.877499\n      00:16\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.809255\n      0.853736\n      00:16\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.769467\n      0.853571\n      00:16\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nlearn.show_results()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      user\n      title\n      rating\n      rating_pred\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      244\n      1305\n      4\n      4.185966\n    \n    \n      1\n      902\n      965\n      3\n      3.474954\n    \n    \n      2\n      87\n      1173\n      5\n      4.206645\n    \n    \n      3\n      759\n      333\n      5\n      4.247213\n    \n    \n      4\n      109\n      1624\n      3\n      3.726794\n    \n    \n      5\n      363\n      743\n      1\n      1.774737\n    \n    \n      6\n      756\n      1216\n      5\n      4.058509\n    \n    \n      7\n      378\n      179\n      4\n      3.192873\n    \n    \n      8\n      18\n      141\n      3\n      3.296141\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nlearn.model\n\nEmbeddingNN(\n  (embeds): ModuleList(\n    (0): Embedding(944, 74)\n    (1): Embedding(1665, 102)\n  )\n  (emb_drop): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False)\n  (bn_cont): BatchNorm1d(0, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (layers): Sequential(\n    (0): LinBnDrop(\n      (0): Linear(in_features=176, out_features=100, bias=False)\n      (1): ReLU(inplace=True)\n      (2): BatchNorm1d(100, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n    )\n    (1): LinBnDrop(\n      (0): Linear(in_features=100, out_features=50, bias=False)\n      (1): ReLU(inplace=True)\n      (2): BatchNorm1d(50, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n    )\n    (2): LinBnDrop(\n      (0): Linear(in_features=50, out_features=1, bias=True)\n    )\n    (3): SigmoidRange(low=0, high=5.5)\n  )\n)\n\n\nThe EmbeddingNN architecture extends the TabularModel class which we will explore in Chapter 9.\nThat finishes my review of Chapter 8, I’ll be working through the “Further Research” section in upcoming blog posts and associated videos:\n\n\nTake a look at all the differences between the Embedding version of DotProductBias and the create_params version, and try to understand why each of those changes is required.

The maximumm 8-bit integer is 127, so we need 16-bit integer for city_mpg since it’s max is 150.\n\ncity_mpg.max()\n\n150\n\n\n\ncity_mpg.astype('Int16')\n\n0        19\n1         9\n2        23\n3        10\n4        17\n         ..\n41139    19\n41140    20\n41141    18\n41142    18\n41143    16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: Int16\n\n\n\ncity_mpg.astype('Int8')\n\nTypeError: cannot safely cast non-equivalent int64 to int8\n\n\nIf you can use a narrower type, you can cut back on memory usage, giving you memory to process more data.\nUse NumPy to inspect limits on integer and float types:\n\nnp.iinfo('int64')\n\niinfo(min=-9223372036854775808, max=9223372036854775807, dtype=int64)\n\n\n\nnp.iinfo('uint8')\n\niinfo(min=0, max=255, dtype=uint8)\n\n\n\nnp.finfo('float16')\n\nfinfo(resolution=0.001, min=-6.55040e+04, max=6.55040e+04, dtype=float16)\n\n\n\nnp.finfo('float64')\n\nfinfo(resolution=1e-15, min=-1.7976931348623157e+308, max=1.7976931348623157e+308, dtype=float64)\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Memory Usage\nUse the .nbytes property or the .memory_usage method to calculate memory usage of the Series.\nPass deep=True to .memory_usage when dealing with object types in the Series.\n\ncity_mpg.nbytes\n\n329152\n\n\n\ncity_mpg.astype('Int16').nbytes\n\n123432\n\n\nTo get the amount of memory that includes strings in the Series (like the make column), we need to use the .memory_usage method:\n\ndf.make\n\n0        Alfa Romeo\n1           Ferrari\n2             Dodge\n3             Dodge\n4            Subaru\n            ...    \n41139        Subaru\n41140        Subaru\n41141        Subaru\n41142        Subaru\n41143        Subaru\nName: make, Length: 41144, dtype: object\n\n\n\ndf.make.nbytes\n\n329152\n\n\n\ndf.make.memory_usage()\n\n329280\n\n\n\ndf.make.memory_usage(deep=True)\n\n2606395\n\n\n.memory_usage includes the index memory and can include the contribution from object types. .nbytes is just the memory that the data is using and not the ancillary parts of the Series.\nConverting to categorical will save a lot of memory for the make data:\n\n(df.make\n .astype('category')\n .memory_usage(deep=True)\n)\n\n95888\n\n\n\n\n8.3 String and Category Types\n\ncity_mpg.astype(str)\n\n0        19\n1         9\n2        23\n3        10\n4        17\n         ..\n41139    19\n41140    20\n41141    18\n41142    18\n41143    16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: object\n\n\n\ncity_mpg.astype('category')\n\n0        19\n1         9\n2        23\n3        10\n4        17\n         ..\n41139    19\n41140    20\n41141    18\n41142    18\n41143    16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: category\nCategories (105, int64): [6, 7, 8, 9, ..., 137, 138, 140, 150]\n\n\nWhen you convert to categorical data, pandas no longer uses Python strings for each value but optimizes it. Potentially large memory savings if you have many duplicate values.\n\n\n8.4 Ordered Categories\nTo cretae ordered categories you need to define your own CategoricalDtype:\n\nvalues = pd.Series(sorted(set(city_mpg)))\ncity_type = pd.CategoricalDtype(categories=values, ordered=True)\ncity_mpg.astype(city_type)\n\n0        19\n1         9\n2        23\n3        10\n4        17\n         ..\n41139    19\n41140    20\n41141    18\n41142    18\n41143    16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: category\nCategories (105, int64): [6 < 7 < 8 < 9 ... 137 < 138 < 140 < 150]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString or Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstr 'str' 'string'\nConvert to Python string.\n\n\n'string'\nConvert type to pandas string (supports pd.NA).\n\n\nint 'int' 'int64'|Convert type to NumPy int64.| |'int32' 'uint32'|Convert type to 32 signed or unsigned NumPy integer (can also use 16 and 8).| |‘Int64’|Convert type to pandas Int64 (supportspd.NA).

Doesn’t try to reduce size of integer or float types\n\n\ns.astype(dtype, copy=True, errors='raise')\nCast series into particular type. If errors='ignore' then return original series on error.\n\n\npd.to_datetime(arg, errors='raise', dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, utc=None, format=None, exact=True, unit=None, infer_datetime_format=False, origin='unix', cache=True)\nConvert arg (a series) into datetime. Use format to specify strftime string.\n\n\ns.to_numpy(dtype=None, copy=False, na_value=object, **kwargs)\nConvert the series to a NumPy array.\n\n\ns.values\nConvert the series to a NumPy array.\n\n\ns.to_frame(name=None)\nReturn a dataframe representation of the series.\n\n\npd.CategoricalDtype(categories=None, ordered=False)\nCreate a type for categorical data.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.7 Exercises\nWith a dataset of your choice:\n1.

They do not have the start value but do include the end value. If the city_mpg series had values with 0 or values above 150, they would be missing after binning the series.\nIf you wanted 10 bins that had approximately the same number of entries in each bin (rather than each bin width being the same) use the qcut function:\n\npd.qcut(city_mpg, 10)\n\n0         (18.0, 20.0]\n1        (5.999, 13.0]\n2         (21.0, 24.0]\n3        (5.999, 13.0]\n4         (16.0, 17.0]\n             ...      \n41139     (18.0, 20.0]\n41140     (18.0, 20.0]\n41141     (17.0, 18.0]\n41142     (17.0, 18.0]\n41143     (15.0, 16.0]\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: category\nCategories (10, interval[float64, right]): [(5.999, 13.0] < (13.0, 14.0] < (14.0, 15.0] < (15.0, 16.0] ...

Returns a series, or dataframe if func returns a series.\n\n\ns.where(cond, other=nan, inplace=False, axis=None, level=None, errors='raise', try_cast=False)\nPass in a boolean series/dataframe, list, or callable as cond. If the value is True, keep it, otherwise use other value. If it is a function, it takes a series and should return a boolean sequence.\n\n\nnp.select(condlist, choicelist, default=0)\nPass in a list of boolean arrays for condlist. If the value is true use the corresponding value from choicelist. If multiple conditions are True, only use the first. Returns a NumPy array.\n\n\ns.fillna(value=None, method=None, axis=None, inplace=False, limit=None, downcast=None)\nPass in a scalar, dict, series or dataframe for value. If it is a scalar, use that value, otherwise use the index from the old value to the new value.\n\n\ns.interpolate(method='linear', axis=0, limit=None, inplace=False, limit_direction=None, limit_area=None, downcast=None, **kwargs)\nPerform interpolation with missing values. method may be linear, time among others.\n\n\ns.clip(lower=None, upper=None, axis=None, inplace=False, *args, **kwargs)\nReturn a new series with values clipped to lower and upper.\n\n\ns.sort_values(axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind='quicksort', na_position='last', ignore_index=False, key=None)\nReturn a series with values sorted. The kind option may be 'quicksort', 'mergesort' (stable), or 'heapsort'. na_position indicates location of NaNs and may be 'first' or 'last'.\n\n\ns.sort_index(axis=0, level=None, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind='quicksort', na_position='last', sort_remaining=True, ignore_index=False, key=None)\nReturn a series with index sorted. The kind option may be 'quicksort', 'mergesort' (stable), or 'heapsort'. na_position indicates location of NaNs and may be 'first' or 'last'.\n\n\ns.drop_duplicates(keep='first', inplace=False)\nDrop duplicates. keep may be 'first', 'last', or False. (If False, it removes all values that were duplicated).\n\n\ns.rank(axis=0, method='average', numeric_only=None, na_option='keep', ascending=True, pct=False)\nReturn a series with numerical ranks. method allows you to specify tie handling. 'average', 'min', 'max', 'first' (usses order they appear in series), 'dense' (like 'min', but rank only increases by one after tie). na_option allows you to specify NaN handling. 'keep' (stay at NaN), 'top' (move to smallest), 'bottom' (move to largest).\n\n\ns.replace(to_replace=None, value=None, inplace=False, limit=None, regex=False, method='pad')\nReturn a series with new values. to_replace can be many things. If it is a string, number or regular expression, you can replace it with a scalar value. It can also be a list of those things which requires value to be a list of the same size. Finally, it can be a dictionary mapping old values to new values.\n\n\npd.cut(x, bins, right=True, labels=None, retbins=False, precision=3, include_lowest=False, duplicates='raise', ordered=True)\nBin values from x (a series). If bins is an integer, use equal-width bins. If bins is a list of numbers (defining minimum and maximum positions) use those for the edges. right defines whether the right edge is open or closed. labels allows you to specify the bin names.

    "text": "Chapter 10: Indexing Operations\nBoth a series and a dataframe have an index. Both types support the Python indexing operator ([]). Both have attributes .loc and .iloc that you can index against.\n\n10.1 Prepping the Data and Renaming the Index\nUse .rename method to hange the index labels. We can pass in a dictionary to map the previous index label to the new label:\n\nimport itertools\n\ndict(itertools.islice(df.make.to_dict().items(), 10))\n\n{0: 'Alfa Romeo',\n 1: 'Ferrari',\n 2: 'Dodge',\n 3: 'Dodge',\n 4: 'Subaru',\n 5: 'Subaru',\n 6: 'Subaru',\n 7: 'Toyota',\n 8: 'Toyota',\n 9: 'Toyota'}\n\n\n\ncity2 = city_mpg.rename(df.make.to_dict())\n\n\ncity2\n\nAlfa Romeo    19\nFerrari        9\nDodge         23\nDodge         10\nSubaru        17\n              ..\nSubaru        19\nSubaru        20\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n# view the index\ncity2.index\n\nIndex(['Alfa Romeo', 'Ferrari', 'Dodge', 'Dodge', 'Subaru', 'Subaru', 'Subaru',\n       'Toyota', 'Toyota', 'Toyota',\n       ...\n       'Saab', 'Saturn', 'Saturn', 'Saturn', 'Saturn', 'Subaru', 'Subaru',\n       'Subaru', 'Subaru', 'Subaru'],\n      dtype='object', length=41144)\n\n\nThe .rename method also accepts a series, a scalar, a function that takes an old label and returns a new lable or a sequence. When we pass in a series and the index values are the same, the values from the series that we passed in are used as the index.\n\ncity2 = city_mpg.rename(df.make)\ncity2\n\nAlfa Romeo    19\nFerrari        9\nDodge         23\nDodge         10\nSubaru        17\n              ..\nSubaru        19\nSubaru        20\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: int64\n\n\nIf you pass a scalar value (a single string) into .rename the index will stay the same but the .name attribute of the series will update:\n\ncity2.rename('citympg')\n\nAlfa Romeo    19\nFerrari        9\nDodge         23\nDodge         10\nSubaru        17\n              ..\nSubaru        19\nSubaru        20\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        18\nSubaru        16\nName: citympg, Length: 41144, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n10.2 Resetting the Index\n.reset_index by default will return a dataframe, moving the current index into a new column:\n\ncity2.reset_index()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      index\n      city08\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Alfa Romeo\n      19\n    \n    \n      1\n      Ferrari\n      9\n    \n    \n      2\n      Dodge\n      23\n    \n    \n      3\n      Dodge\n      10\n    \n    \n      4\n      Subaru\n      17\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      41139\n      Subaru\n      19\n    \n    \n      41140\n      Subaru\n      20\n    \n    \n      41141\n      Subaru\n      18\n    \n    \n      41142\n      Subaru\n      18\n    \n    \n      41143\n      Subaru\n      16\n    \n  \n\n41144 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\ndrop=True drops the current index and returns a Series.\n\ncity2.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n0        19\n1         9\n2        23\n3        10\n4        17\n         ..\n41139    19\n41140    20\n41141    18\n41142    18\n41143    16\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: int64\n\n\nNote that .sort_values and .sort_index keep the same index but just rearrange the order so they do not impact operations that align on the index.\n\n\n10.3 The .loc Attribute\nThe .loc attribute deals with index labels. You can pass the following into an index operation on .loc:\n\nA scalar value of one of the index labels.\nA list of index labels.\nA slice of labels (closed interval so it includes the stop value).\nAn index.\nA boolean array (same index labels as the series, but with True and False values).\nA function that accepts a series and returns one of the above.\n\nIf there are duplicate labels in the index, and you pass in a scalar with the label of an index, it will return a series. If there is only one value for that label it will return a scalar.\n\ncity2.loc['Subaru']\n\nSubaru    17\nSubaru    21\nSubaru    22\nSubaru    19\nSubaru    20\n          ..\nSubaru    19\nSubaru    20\nSubaru    18\nSubaru    18\nSubaru    16\nName: city08, Length: 885, dtype: int64\n\n\n\ncity2.loc['Fisker']\n\n20\n\n\nIf you want to guarantee that a series is returned, pass in a list rather than passing in a scalar value:\n\ncity2.loc[['Fisker']]\n\nFisker    20\nName: city08, dtype: int64\n\n\n\ncity2.loc[['Ferrari', 'Lamborghini']]\n\nFerrari         9\nFerrari        12\nFerrari        11\nFerrari        10\nFerrari        11\n               ..\nLamborghini     6\nLamborghini     8\nLamborghini     8\nLamborghini     8\nLamborghini     8\nName: city08, Length: 357, dtype: int64\n\n\nSort the index if you are slicing with duplicate index labels:\n\ncity2.loc['Ferrari':'Lamborghini']\n\nKeyError: \"Cannot get left slice bound for non-unique label: 'Ferrari'\"\n\n\n\ncity2.sort_index().loc['Ferrari':'Lamborghini']\n\nFerrari        10\nFerrari        13\nFerrari        13\nFerrari         9\nFerrari        10\n               ..\nLamborghini    12\nLamborghini     9\nLamborghini     8\nLamborghini    13\nLamborghini     8\nName: city08, Length: 11210, dtype: int64\n\n\nSlicing with .loc follows the closed interval, includes both the start index and the final index.\nIf you have a sorted index, you can slice with strings that are not actual labels.\n\ncity2.sort_index().loc[\"F\":\"J\"]\n\nFederal Coach    15\nFederal Coach    13\nFederal Coach    13\nFederal Coach    14\nFederal Coach    13\n                 ..\nIsuzu            15\nIsuzu            15\nIsuzu            15\nIsuzu            27\nIsuzu            18\nName: city08, Length: 9040, dtype: int64\n\n\nYou can also pass an Index to .loc:\n\nidx = pd.Index(['Dodge'])\ncity2.loc[idx]\n\nDodge    23\nDodge    10\nDodge    12\nDodge    11\nDodge    11\n         ..\nDodge    18\nDodge    17\nDodge    14\nDodge    14\nDodge    11\nName: city08, Length: 2583, dtype: int64\n\n\nIf we duplicate 'Dodge' in the Index, the previous operation has twice as many values, a combinatoric explosion:\n\nidx = pd.Index(['Dodge', 'Dodge'])\ncity2.loc[idx]\n\nDodge    23\nDodge    10\nDodge    12\nDodge    11\nDodge    11\n         ..\nDodge    18\nDodge    17\nDodge    14\nDodge    14\nDodge    11\nName: city08, Length: 5166, dtype: int64\n\n\nYou can also pass a boolean array to .loc:\n\nmask = city2 > 50\nmask\n\nAlfa Romeo    False\nFerrari       False\nDodge         False\nDodge         False\nSubaru        False\n              ...  \nSubaru        False\nSubaru        False\nSubaru        False\nSubaru        False\nSubaru        False\nName: city08, Length: 41144, dtype: bool\n\n\n\ncity2.loc[mask]\n\nNissan     81\nToyota     81\nToyota     81\nFord       74\nNissan     84\n         ... \nTesla     140\nTesla     115\nTesla     104\nTesla      98\nToyota     55\nName: city08, Length: 236, dtype: int64\n\n\nYou can use a function with .loc.

I’ll run 100 trainings for the neural net, record the losses and accuracy, and then plot them to see how they vary by epoch and by training loop.\nI am also inspired by (and learned from) this forum post by a fastai community member (sign-in required) where they plotted losses, gradients, parameters and accuracy for various training runs that included or excluded params.grad_zero() and L2 regularization. They found that for a simple linear model, zeroing the gradients leads to more stable training, smaller coefficients and higher accuracy than letting gradients accumulate each epoch."

With that confirmed, I can run my trial of 100 trainings, and then plot the results:\n\n\nTraining Multiple Models\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models()\n\n\nrecorder.head()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      run\n      epoch\n      trn_loss\n      val_loss\n      acc\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0\n      0\n      0.552340\n      0.540915\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      1\n      0\n      1\n      0.488773\n      0.491162\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      2\n      0\n      2\n      0.474533\n      0.479952\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      3\n      0\n      3\n      0.461460\n      0.469660\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      4\n      0\n      4\n      0.450005\n      0.460642\n      0.595506\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nrecorder.tail()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      run\n      epoch\n      trn_loss\n      val_loss\n      acc\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      25\n      99\n      25\n      0.390775\n      0.414015\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      26\n      99\n      26\n      0.390258\n      0.413608\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      27\n      99\n      27\n      0.389781\n      0.413232\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      28\n      99\n      28\n      0.389341\n      0.412886\n      0.595506\n    \n    \n      29\n      99\n      29\n      0.388933\n      0.412565\n      0.595506\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nrecorder.max()\n\nrun               99\nepoch             29\ntrn_loss    0.623253\nval_loss    0.604715\nacc         0.831461\ndtype: object\n\n\n\nPlot: Training Loss\n\n(recorder\n .pivot_table(values='trn_loss', index='epoch', columns='run')\n .plot(color='green', alpha=0.3, legend=False, title='Training Loss'));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot: Validation Loss\n\n(recorder\n .pivot_table(values='val_loss', index='epoch', columns='run')\n .plot(color='red', alpha=0.3, legend=False, title='Validation Loss'));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot: Accuracy\n\n(recorder\n .pivot_table(values='acc', index='epoch', columns='run')\n .plot(color='blue', alpha=0.3, legend=False, title='Accuracy'));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis exercise was fascinating, both in terms of building the code to record losses and accuracy for each epoch, as well as observing the final results of 100 training runs.\nThe main observation that stands out: for all three values (training loss, validation loss and accuracy) there were training runs where the values did not improve at all between the first and last epoch. In the case of training and validation loss, it seems like there were numerous runs where the loss was stuck at around 0.4. There were many trainings where the accuracy was stuck at around 0.6.\nOnly for a handful of training runs did the accuracy cross 0.8.\nIn a significant number of runs (as seen by the darkness of the line color on the plot) the training and validation loss gradually decreased during training.\nAfter running this experiment I am pretty surprised. I knew that training neural networks involved some variability, but it’s almost shocking to see how you can get wildly different results for training the same model. Just by happenchance, I can get a model that seemingly does not work (accuracy stuck throughout) and the same model that achieves a better accuracy than the baseline in Jeremy’s notebook. All in all, I’m grateful that I did this exercise because it gave me some perspective on how volatile neural nets can be."

    "text": "Backstory\nI started this project by reading the handbook Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What State and Local Government Users Need to Know published by the U.S. Census Bureau. I recreated the handbook’s first case study in R, in which they make comparisons across geographic areas, create custom geographic areas from census tracts and calculate margins of error for derived estimates for Minnesota Census Tract 5-year earnings estimates.\nDuring the process of recreating the derived median earnings estimate calculations, I was unable to recreate a key value from the handbook (the Standard Error for the 50% proportion, calculated to be 0.599) because I was unable to deduce the values used in the following formula referenced from page 17 of the PUMS Accuracy of the Data documentation:\n\n\n\nStandard Error equals Design Factor times square root of the product of 95 over 5B and 50 squared\n\n\nThe documentation defines B as the base, which is the calculated weighted total. I chose the value of 1.3 for the design factor DF since it corresponds to STATE = Minnesota, CHARTYP = Population, CHARACTERISTIC = Person Earnings/Income in the Design Factors CSV published by the Census Bureau.\nI called the Census Bureau Customer Help Center for assistance and was transferred to a member of the ACS Data User Support team with whom I discussed my woes. He was unable to confirm the values of the design factor DF or B, and was unable to pull up the contact information for the statistical methodology team, so I emailed him my questions. After a few email exchanges, the statistical methodology team provided the following:\n\nDF = 1.3\nB = the total population estimate for which the median is being calculated, which is 82488 for the case study calculation (Minnesota Rural Male Full Time Workers)\nThe term 95/5 is associated with the finite population correction factor (100 - f) divided by the sample fraction (f), where f = 5% (later on I note in the documentation that this 95/5 term is based on a 68% confidence interval). The data used in the handbook case study is from 5-year estimates. 1-year estimates sample 2.5% of the population, so the 5-year estimates represent a 5 * 2.5 = 12.5% sample. Instead of 95/5, the ratio becomes (100 - 12.5)/12.5 = 87.5/12.5\n\nThe updated formula is then:\n\n\n\nStandard Error equals Design Factor times square root of the product of 87.5 over 12.5B and 50 squared\n\n\nI was able to calculate the median earnings estimate (and associated standard error and margin of error) within a few percent of the values given in the handbook. This provided me with confirmation that I was ready to expand my code to calculate median earnings estimates for other subgroups."

    "section": "app.R",
    "text": "app.R\nA shiny app has three fundamental components:\nui <- (...)\nserver <- (...)\nshinyApp(ui, server,...)\nThe ui object holds all UI layout, input and output objects which define the front-end of your app. The server object holds all rendering functions which are assigned to outputs that appear on the UI. The shinyApp function takes a ui and server object (along with other arguments) and creates a shiny app object which can be run in a browser by passing it to the runApp function. Person inputs (such as selections in a dropdown) are assigned to a global input object.\n\nWhat’s in my ui?\nAll of my UI objects are wrapped within a fluidPage call which returns a page layout which “consists of rows which in turn include columns” (from the docs).\nMy app’s UI has four sections:\n\nDropdowns to select state, sex and work status for which the person using the app wants ACS 5-year earnings estimates\n\n\n\nA table with the estimate, standard error and margin of error for median earnings\n\n\n\n\nA table with the estimate, standard error and margin of error for median earnings\n\n\n\nA bar plot of population estimates for earnings levels for the selected state, sex, work status and RUCA (Rural-Urban Commuting Areas) level\n\n\n\n\nA bar plot of population estimates for earnings levels for the selected state, sex, work status and RUCA (Rural-Urban Commuting Areas) level\n\n\n\nA table with population estimates for earnings levels for each RUCA level for the selected state, sex and work status\n\nEach section has a download button so that people can get the CSV files or plot image for their own analysis and reporting. Each section is separated with markdown('---') which renders an HTML horizontal rule (<hr>).\n\nDropdowns\nDropdowns (the HTML <select> element) are a type of UI Input. I define each with an inputId which is a character object for reference on the server-side, a label character object which is rendered above the dropdown, and a list object which defines the dropdown options.\nselectInput(\n  inputId = \"...\",\n  label = \"...\",\n  choices = list(...)\n)\nIn some cases, I want the person to see a character object in the dropdown that is more human-readable (e.g. \"Large Town\") but use a corresponding input value in the server which is more computer-readable (e.g. \"Large_Town). To achieve this, I use a named character vector where the names are displayed in the dropdown, and the assigned values are assigned to the global input:\nselectInput(\n     inputId = \"ruca_level\",\n     label = \"Select RUCA Level\",\n     choices = list(\n       \"RUCA LEVEL\" = c(\n       \"Urban\" = \"Urban\", \n       \"Large Town\" = \"Large_Town\", \n       \"Small Town\" = \"Small_Town\", \n       \"Rural\" = \"Rural\"))\n     )\nIn this case, if the person selects \"Large Town\" the value assigned to input$ruca_level is \"Large_Town\".\n\n\nTables\nTables (the HTML <table> element) are a type of UI Output. I define each with an outputId for reference in the server.\ntableOutput(outputId = \"...\")\n\n\nPlot\nSimilarly, a plot (which is rendered as an HTML <img> element) is a type of UI Output. I define each with an outputId.\nplotOutput(outputId = \"...\")\n\n\nDownload Buttons\nThe download button (an HTML <a> element) is also a type of UI Output. I define each with an outputId and label (which is displayed as the HTML textContent attribute of the <a> element).\ndownloadButton(\n  outputId = \"...\",\n  label = \"...\"\n)\n\n\n\nWhat does my server do?\nThe server function has three parameters: input, output and session. The input object is a ReactiveValues object which stores all UI Input values, which are accessed with input$inputId. The output object similarly holds UI Output values at output$outputId. I do not use the session object in my app (yet).\nMy app’s server has four sections:\n\nGet data from the SQLite database\nRender table and plot outputs\nPrepare dynamic text (for filenames and the plot title)\nHandle data.frame and plot downloads\n\n\nGet Data\nThere are three high-level functions which call query/format/calculation functions to return the data in the format necessary to produce table, text, download and plot outputs:\n\nThe earnings_data function passes the person-selected dropdown options input$sex, input$work_status and input$state to the get_b20005_ruca_aggregate_earnings function to get a query result from the SQLite database. That function call is passed to format_earnings, which in turn is passed to the reactive function to make it a reactive expression. Only reactive expressions (and reactive endpoints in the output object) are allowed to access the input object which is a reactive source. You can read more about Shiny’s “reactive programming model” in this excellent article.\n\nearnings_data <- reactive(\n  format_earnings(\n    get_b20005_ruca_aggregate_earnings(\n      input$sex, \n      input$work_status, \n      input$state)))\n\nThe design_factor function passes the input$state selection to the get_design_factor function which in turn is passed to the reactive function.\n\ndesign_factor <- reactive(get_design_factor(input$state))\n\nThe median_data function passes the return values from earnings_data() and design_factor() to the calculate_median function which in turn is passed to the reactive function.\n\nmedian_data <- reactive(calculate_median(earnings_data(), design_factor()))\n\n\nRender Outputs\nI have two reactive endpoints for table outputs, and one endpoint for a plot. The table outputs use renderTable (with row names displayed) with the data.frame coming from median_data() and earnings_data(). The plot output uses renderPlot, and a helper function make_plot to create a bar plot of earnings_data() for a person-selected input$ruca_level with a title created with the helper function earnings_plot_title().\noutput$median_data <- renderTable(\n  expr = median_data(), \n  rownames = TRUE)\n  \noutput$earnings_data <- renderTable(\n  expr = earnings_data(), \n  rownames = TRUE)\n    \noutput$earnings_histogram <- renderPlot(\n  expr = make_plot(\n    data=earnings_data(), \n    ruca_level=input$ruca_level, \n    plot_title=earnings_plot_title()))\n\n\nPrepare Dynamic Text\nI created four functions that generate filenames for the downloadHandler call when the corresponding downloadButton gets clicked, one function that generates the title used to generate the bar plot, and one function which takes computer-readable character objects (e.g. \"Large_Town\") and maps it to and returns a more human-readable character object (e.g. \"Large Town\"). I chose to keep filenames more computer-readable (to avoid spaces) and the plot title more human-readable.\nget_pretty_text <- function(raw_text){\n  text_map <- c(\"M\" = \"Male\", \n  \"F\" = \"Female\",\n  \"FT\" = \"Full Time\",\n  \"OTHER\" = \"Other\",\n  \"Urban\" = \"Urban\",\n  \"Large_Town\" = \"Large Town\",\n  \"Small_Town\" = \"Small Town\",\n  \"Rural\" = \"Rural\")\n  return(text_map[raw_text])\n  }\n \nearnings_plot_title <- function(){\n  return(paste(\n    input$state,\n    get_pretty_text(input$sex),\n    get_pretty_text(input$work_status),\n    input$ruca_level,\n    \"Workers\",\n    sep=\" \"))\n  }\n\nb20005_filename <- function(){\n    return(paste(\n      input$state,\n      get_pretty_text(input$sex),\n      input$work_status,\n      \"earnings.csv\",\n      sep=\"_\"\n    ))\n  }\n  \nmedian_summary_filename <- function() {\n  paste(\n    input$state,  \n    get_pretty_text(input$sex), \n    input$work_status, \n    'estimated_median_earnings_summary.csv',  \n    sep=\"_\")\n  }\n  \nruca_earnings_filename <- function() {\n  paste(\n    input$state,  \n    get_pretty_text(input$sex),  \n    input$work_status, \n    'estimated_median_earnings_by_ruca_level.csv',  \n    sep=\"_\")\n  }\n  \nearnings_plot_filename <- function(){\n  return(paste(\n    input$state,\n    get_pretty_text(input$sex),\n    input$work_status,\n    input$ruca_level,\n    \"Workers.png\",\n    sep=\"_\"))\n  }\n\n\nHandle downloads\nI have five download buttons in my app: two which trigger a download of a zip file with two CSVs, two that downloads a single CSV, and one that downloads a single PNG. The downloadHandler function takes a filename and a content function to write data to a file.\nIn order to create a zip file, I use the zip base package function and pass it a vector with two filepaths (to which data is written using the base package’s write.csv function) and a filename. I also specify the contentType as \"application/zip\". In the zip file, one of the CSVs contains a query result from the b20005 SQLite database table with earnings data, and the other file, \"b20005_variables.csv\" contains B20005 table variable names and descriptions. In order to avoid the files being written locally before download, I create a temporary directory with tempdir and prepend it to the filename to create the filepath.\nFor the bar plot image download, I use the ggplot2 package’s ggsave function, which takes a filename, a plot object (returned from the make_plot helper function) and the character object \"png\" (for the device parameter).\noutput$download_selected_b20005_data <- downloadHandler(\n    filename = \"b20005_data.zip\",\n    content = function(fname) {\n      # Create a temporary directory to prevent local storage of new files\n      temp_dir <- tempdir()\n      \n      # Create two filepath character objects and store them in a list\n      # which will later on be passed to the `zip` function\n      path1 <- paste(temp_dir, '/', b20005_filename(), sep=\"\")\n      path2 <- paste(temp_dir, \"/b20005_variables.csv\", sep=\"\")\n      fs <- c(path1, path2)\n      \n      # Create a CSV with person-selection input values and do not add a column\n      # with row names\n      write.csv(\n        get_b20005_earnings(input$state, input$sex, input$work_status), \n        path1,\n        row.names = FALSE)\n      \n      # Create a CSV for table B20005 variable names and labels for reference\n      write.csv(\n        get_b20005_ALL_labels(),\n        path2,\n        row.names = FALSE)\n      \n      # Zip together the files and add flags to maximize compression\n      zip(zipfile = fname, files=fs, flags = \"-r9Xj\")\n    },\n    contentType = \"application/zip\"\n  )\n  \noutput$download_all_b20005_data <- downloadHandler(\n  filename = \"ALL_B20005_data.zip\",\n  content = function(fname){\n    path1 <- \"ALL_B20005_data.csv\"\n    path2 <- \"b20005_variables.csv\"\n    fs <- c(path1, path2)\n    \n    write.csv(\n      get_b20005_earnings('ALL', 'ALL', 'ALL'),\n      path1,\n      row.names = FALSE)\n    \n    write.csv(\n      get_b20005_ALL_labels(),\n      path2,\n      row.names = FALSE)\n    \n    zip(zipfile = fname, files=fs, flags = \"-r9Xj\")\n    },\n    contentType = \"application/zip\"\n  )\n  \noutput$download_median_summary <- downloadHandler(\n  filename = median_summary_filename(),\n  content = function(file) {\n    write.csv(median_data(), file)\n    }\n  )\n  \noutput$download_earnings_plot <- downloadHandler(\n  filename = earnings_plot_filename(),\n  content = function(file) {\n    ggsave(\n      file, \n      plot = make_plot(\n        data=earnings_data(), \n        ruca_level=input$ruca_level, \n        plot_title=earnings_plot_title()), \n        device = \"png\")\n      }\n  )\n  \noutput$download_ruca_earnings <- downloadHandler(\n  filename = ruca_earnings_filename(),\n  content = function(file) {\n    write.csv(earnings_data(), file)\n  }\n  )"

    "text": "get_b20005_ruca_aggregate_earnings.R\nThe function inside this script (with the same name), receives inputs from the server, sends queries to the database and returns the results. This process involves two steps:\n\nGet Variable Names\nThe person using the app selects Sex (M or F), Work Status (Full Time or Other) and State (50 states + D.C. + Puerto Rico) for which they want to view and analyze earnings data. As shown above, different variables in table b20005 correspond to different sexes and work statuses, and each tract for which there is all that earnings data resides in a given state.\nI first query b20005_vars to get the relevent variables names which will be used in the query to b20005, as shown below. names that end with “M” (queried with the wilcard '%M') are for margins of error and those that end with “E” (wildcard '%E') are for estimates.\nvars <- dbGetQuery(\n    census_app_db, \n    \"SELECT name FROM b20005_vars \n    WHERE label LIKE $label_wildcard \n    AND name LIKE '%M'\",\n    params=list(label_wildcard=label_wildcard))\nThe b20005_vars.label column holds long string labels (which follow a consistent pattern, which is captured by the $label_wildcard) that describe the variable’s contents. Here are a couple of examples: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb20005_vars.name\nb20005_vars.label\n\n\n\n\nB20005_053E\n\"Estimate!!Total!!Female!!Worked full-time, year-round in the past 12 months!!With earnings\")\n\n\nB20005_076M\n\"Margin of Error!!Total!!Female!!Other!!With earnings!!$1 to $2,499 or loss\"\n\n\n\n\nSince the label string contains the sex and work status, I assign a label_wildcard based on the person inputs from the sex and work status UI dropdowns.\n# Prepare wildcard for query parameter `label_wildcard`\n  if (sex == 'M') {\n    if (work_status == 'FT') { label_wildcard <- \"%!!Male!!Worked%\" }\n    if (work_status == 'OTHER') { label_wildcard <- \"%!!Male!!Other%\" }\n  }\n  \n  if (sex == 'F') {\n    if (work_status == 'FT') { label_wildcard <- \"%!!Female!!Worked%\" }\n    if (work_status == 'OTHER') { label_wildcard <- \"%!!Female!!Other%\" }\n  }\n\n\nDerive RUCA Level Estimates and MOE\nOnce the variables are returned, the actual values are queried from b20005, grouped by RUCA level. The ACS handbook Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know shows how to calculate that margin of error for derived estimates. In our case, the margin of error for a RUCA level such as “Urban” for a given state is derived from the margin of error of individual Census Tracts using the formula below:\n\n\n\nThe MOE for a sum of estimates is the square root of the sum of MOEs squared\n\n\nTranslating this to a SQLite query:\n# Construct query string to square root of the sum of margins of error squared grouped by ruca level\nquery_string <- paste0(\n    \"SQRT(SUM(POWER(b20005.\", vars$name, \", 2))) AS \", vars$name, collapse=\",\")\nWhere vars$name is a list of variable names, and the collapse parameter converts a list or vector to a string. The beginning of that query_string looks like:\n\"SQRT(SUM(POWER(b20005.B20005_001M, 2))) AS B20005_001M, SQRT(...\"\nThe query is further built by adding the rest of the SQL statements:\nquery_string <- paste(\n    \"SELECT ruca.DESCRIPTION,\",\n    query_string,\n    \"FROM 'b20005' \n    INNER JOIN ruca \n    ON b20005.state || b20005.county || b20005.tract = ruca.TRACTFIPS\n    WHERE \n    b20005.state = $state\n    GROUP BY ruca.DESCRIPTION\"\n  )\nThe ruca.DESCRIPTION column, which contains RUCA levels (e.g. \"Urban\") is joined onto b20005 from the ruca table using the foreign keys representing the Census Tract FIPS code (TRACTFIPS for the ruca table and the concatenated field state || county || tract for b20005). The $state parameter is assigned the person-selected state input, and the columns are aggreaggated by RUCA levels (i.e. GROUP BY ruca.DESCRIPTION). Finally, the RUCA level and square root of the sum of MOEs squared are SELECTed from the joined tables.\nThe query for estimates is simpler than MOEs, because estimates only need to be summed over RUCA levels:\n# Construct a query to sum estimates grouped by ruca level\n  query_string <- paste0(\"SUM(b20005.\",vars$name, \") AS \", vars$name, collapse=\",\")\nget_b20005_ruca_aggregate_earnings returns the query result data.frames in a named list:\nreturn(list(\"estimate\" = estimate_rs, \"moe\" = moe_rs))"

    "text": "Plan of Attack\nThere are a few places in the existing code that I’ll need to modify to fit a two-output use case:\n\nPrepping the Data\nCurrently, there are 12 different independent variables and 1 dependent variable. In my use case, I will have 11 independent variables and 2 dependent variables (Age and Survived).\nThe current dependent variables are turned into column vectors as follows:\ntrn_dep = trn_dep[:,None]\nval_dep = val_dep[:,None]\nI’m not sure if I’ll have to do this for two dependent variables as well. It’s something I’ll look into and make sure matches the expected shape before I proceed.\n\n\nInitializing Coefficients\nCurrently, the sizes of each of the layers of the deep neural net are as follows:\nhiddens = [10,10]\nsizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [1]\nFor a model with two outputs, the last layer will have size 2:\nsizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n\n\nCalculating Predictions\nWhen calculating predictions for one output, the final line returns torch.sigmoid of the result. In my case, that will work for predicting Survived since it’s between 0 and 1, but Age is a continuous variable that can be greater than 0 so instead of sigmoid I’ll use F.relu and see if that works.\n\n\nCalculating Loss\nHere’s the current loss function:\ndef calc_loss(coeffs, indeps, deps): return torch.abs(calc_preds(coeffs, indeps)-deps).mean()\nGiven broadcasting, I think it should work as is, but will test it out and see.\n\n\nCalculating Metrics\nAccuracy is calculated as follows:\ndef acc(coeffs): return (val_dep.bool()==(calc_preds(coeffs, val_indep)>0.5)).float().mean()\nThis will work for my first output (Survived) but I will need something else like Root Mean Squared Error for the second output Age which is continuous."

The training runs don’t look promising—there are sharp changes in loss and RMSE, and the accuracy plateaus quickly. I would hope to see relatively smooth curves in both losses and metrics across epochs.\nJeremy had mentioned in the lesson video that he had to fiddle with some of the constants inside the neural network as well as the learning rate to get a stable training. So with that in mind, I’ll give it a try and adjust those values and see if it makes training more stable.\nThe two things I’ll fiddle with: the arbitrary constants in init_coeffs and the learning rate.\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-0.5)/sizes[i+1]*6 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*0.5 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models()\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing some of the constants somewhat improved the loss and RMSE and significantly improved the accuracy:\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.8370786309242249, 13.419356346130371)\n\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.03)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the learning rate significantly changed the way losses and RMSE change over time and seems to have made accuracy more chaotic. The minimum RMSE still remains at around 13:\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.7921348214149475, 13.494928359985352)\n\n\nI’ll continue to increase the constants in the model and the learning rate:\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-0.75)/sizes[i+1]*8 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*0.75 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.05)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.6404494643211365, 30.712871551513672)\n\n\nI seem to have broken the model, I’ll keep increasing the constants and learning rate one more time and see it if continues to break the training:\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-1.0)/sizes[i+1]*10 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*1.00 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.07)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\nOkay continuing to increase them is not helping. I’ll go in the opposite direction—-decreasing the constants and learning rate:\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-0.1)/sizes[i+1]*2 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*0.05 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.005)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.40449437499046326, 23.53632354736328)\n\n\nThe trainings look MUCH smoother in terms of loss and RMSE, however the accuracy does not improve at all in any of the 100 trainings and the minimum RMSE achieved is not as low as some of the previous configurations. I’ll increase the learning rate and keep the constants as they are:\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.01)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.40449437499046326, 15.42644214630127)\n\n\nMoving in the right direction for RMSE but still getting a bad accuracy. I’ll increase the learning rate a bit more:\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.03)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.40449437499046326, 13.523417472839355)\n\n\nSomething about this new model favors Age and penalizes Survived. It’s hard to know what is really going on. I’ll continue to fiddle with the parameters:\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-0.1)/sizes[i+1]*1 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*1 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.01)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.5955055952072144, 26.605520248413086)\n\n\nI’ll return to a previous configuration which yielded a pretty high accuracy (79%) and the lowest RMSE so far (13.5).\n\ndef init_coeffs(n_coeff):\n    hiddens = [10, 10]  # <-- set this to the size of each hidden layer you want\n    sizes = [n_coeff] + hiddens + [2]\n    n = len(sizes)\n    layers = [(torch.rand(sizes[i], sizes[i+1])-0.5)/sizes[i+1]*6 for i in range(n-1)]\n    consts = [(torch.rand(1)[0]-0.5)*0.5 for i in range(n-1)]\n    for l in layers+consts: l.requires_grad_()\n    return layers,consts\n\n\nrecorder = train_multiple_models(lr=0.1)\n\n\nplot_recorder(recorder)\n\n\n\n\n\nrecorder['acc'].max(), recorder['rmse'].min()\n\n(0.7977527976036072, 12.552786827087402)\n\n\nI could go on and on with changing arbitrary constants and the learning rate, but I’ll stop here as I’m getting a relatively stable training with a high accuracy and low RMSE. I’ll take a look at Age predictions more closely here:\n\npreds = calc_preds(coeffs, val_indep)\n\n\nage_df = pd.DataFrame({'age_actual': val_dep[:,1].numpy(), 'age_pred': preds[:,1].detach().numpy()})\n\n\nage_df.plot();\n\n\n\n\nThe model didn’t really learn anything useful on how to calculate age. It essentially just found some average value and stuck with it for each passenger."

I understand correctly, we will get 2 columns of predictions, and two variables of targets to compute the loss with:\n\ndef age_loss(pred, yb): return F.mse_loss(pred[:,0], yb[:,0])\ndef survived_loss(pred, yb): return F.mse_loss(pred[:,1], yb[:,1])\n\ndef combine_loss(pred, yb): return age_loss(pred, yb) + survived_loss(pred, yb)\n\n\n\nCreate Metric Function\nI’ll create an RMSE function for each target variable:\n\ndef age_rmse(pred, yb): return torch.sqrt(F.mse_loss(pred[:,0], yb[:,0]))\ndef survived_rmse(pred, yb): return torch.sqrt(F.mse_loss(pred[:,1],

rate finder, the loss was steadily increasing from the get-go.

I’ll use the validation set to get predictions and then calculate accuracy for Survived and correlation between actuals vs. predictions for Age.\n\npreds, targ = learn.get_preds(dl=dls.valid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Survived accuracy\n(targ[:,1] == (preds[:,1]>0.5)).float().mean()\n\ntensor(0.6348)\n\n\n\ndef corr(x,y): return np.corrcoef(x,y)[0][1]\n\n\n# Age plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n\nax.axis('equal')\nplt.title(f'Predicted Age vs Actual; r: {corr(preds[:,0], targ[:,0]):.2f}')\nax.scatter(preds[:,0], targ[:,0]);\n\n\n\n\nThe model achieved shoddy accuracy (63%) and an uninspiring correlation between predicted and actual age. The model did particularly poorly in predicting ages above 40."

Something about introducing an output for Age decreases the model’s performance when predicting survival rate.\nA two-target regression model (Survived and Age) predicts Age with about the same correlation as a single-target model (Age only).\n\nSomething about this dataset (and how the model learns from it) makes Age a poor target for prediction. Perhaps it’s the distribution of ages in the dataset, or the relationship with other columns, that makes it harder for the model to predict it accurately.\nI’m happy and proud that I was able to run this experiment after failing to overcome some errors the first couple of times I tried to train a two-target model earlier this week.\nI hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

The linear model predicts vote share roughly to an accuracy of 3.9 percentage points.\nSome of the most important uses of regression:\n\nPrediction: Modeling existing observations or forecasting new data.\nExploring associations: Summarizing how well one variable, or set of variables, predicts the outcome. One can use a model to explore associations, stratifications, or structural relationships between variables.\nExtrapolation: Adjusting for known differences between the sample (observed data) and a population of interest.\nCausal inference: Estimating treatment effects. A key challenge of causal inference is ensuring that treatment and control groups are similar, on average, before exposure to treatment, or else adjusting for differences between these groups.\n\n\n\n1.3 Some examples of regression\n\nEstimating public opinion from an opt-in internet survey\n\nA characteristic problem of big data: a very large sample, relatively inexpensive to collect, but not immediately representative of the larger population\n\n\n\nA randomized experiment on the effect of an educational television program\n\n\nEstimating the effects of United Nations peacekeeping, using pre-treatment variables to adjust for differences between treatment and control groups\n\nSelection bias: perhaps peacekeepers chose the easy cases, which would explain the difference in outcomes. The treatment–peacekeeping–was not randomly assigned. They had an observational study rather than an experiment, where we must do our best to adjust for pre-treatment differences between the treatment and control groups.\nCensoring: certain ranges of data cannot be observed (e.g. countries where civil war had not yet returned by the time data collection ended)\nWhen adjusting for badness, peacekeeping was performed in tougher conditions, on average. As a result, the adjustment increases the estimated beneficial effects of peacekeeping, at least during the study.\n\n\n\nEstimating the effects of gun laws, and the difficulty of inference using regression with a large number of predictors\n\nIn this sort of regression with 50 data points and 30 predictors and no prior information to guide the inference, the coefficient estimates will be hopelessly noisy and compromised by dependence among predictors.\nThe treatments are observational and not externally applied. There is no reason to believe that the big differences in gun-related deaths between states are mostly attributable to particular policies.\n\n\n\nComparing the peacekeeping and gun-control studies\n\nIn both cases, policy conclusions have been drawn from observational data, using regression modeling to adjust for differences between treatment and control groups.\nIt is more practical to perform adjustments when there is a single goal (peacekeeping study)\n\nparticular concern that the UN might be more likely to step in when the situation on the ground was not so bad\nthe data analysis found the opposite\nthe measure of badness is constructed based on particular measured variables and so it is possible that there are important unmeasured characteristics that would cause adjustments to go the other way\n\nThe gun-control model adjusts for many potential causal variables at once\n\nThe effect of each law is estimated conditional on all others being held constant (not realistic—no particular reason for their effects to add up in a simple manner)\nThe comparison is between states, which vary in systematic ways (it is not at all clear that a simple model can hope to adjust for the relevant differences)\nRegression analysis was taken naively to be able to control for variation and give valid causal inference from observational data\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Challenges in building, understanding, and interpreting regressions\nTwo different ways in which regression is used for causal inference: estimating a relationship and adjusting for background variables.\n\nRegression to estimate a relationship of interest\nRandomization: a design in which people—or, more generally, experimental units—are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups.\nThere are various ways to attain approximate comparability of treatment and control groups, and to adjust for known or modeled differences between the groups.\nWe assume the comparability of the groups assigned to different treatments so that a regression analysis predicting the outcome given the treatment gives us a direct estimate of the causal effect.\nIt is always possible to estimate a linear model, even if it does not fit the data.\nInteractions: treatment effects that vary as a function of other predictors in a model.\n\nExample: the relation between cancer rate and radon is different for smokers and nonsmokers. The effect of radon is assumed to be linear but with an interaction with smoking.\n\n\n\nRegression to adjust for differences between treatment and control groups\nIn most real-world causal inference problems, there are systematic differences between experimental units that receive treatment and control. In such settings it is important to adjust for pre-treatment differences between the groups, and we can use regression to do this.\nAdjusting for background variables is particularly important when there is imbalance so that the treated and control groups differ on key pre-treatment predictors.\nThe estimated treatment effect is necessarily model based.\n\n\nInterpreting coefficients in a predictive model\nA model fit to survey data: earnings = 11000 + 1500 * (height - 60) + error, with errors in the range of mean of 0 and standard deviation of 22000.\n\nPrediction: useless for forecasting because errors are too large\nExploring an association: best fit for this example, as the estimated slope is positive, can lead to further research to study reasons taller people earn more than shorter people\nSampling inference: the regression coefficients can be interpreted directly to the extent that people in the survey are a representative sample of the population of interest\nCausal inference: height is not a randomly assigned treatment. Tall and short people may differ in many other ways.\n\n\n\nBuilding, interpreting and checking regression models\nStatistical analysis cycles through four steps:\n\nModel building\nModel fitting\nUnderstanding model fits\nCriticism\n\nAccept that we can learn from statistical analysis—we can generalize from sample to population, from treatment to control, and from observed measurements to underlying constructs of interest—even while these inferences can be flawed.\nOverinterpretation of noisy data: the gun control study took existing variations among states and too eagerly attributed it to available factors.\nNo study is perfect.\nWe should recognize challenges in extrapolation and then work to adjust for them.\n\n\n\n1.5 Classical and Bayesian Inference\nThree concerns related to fitting models to data and using models to make predictions:\n\nwhat information is being used in the estimation process\nwhat assumptions are being made\nhow estimates and predictions are interpreted, in a classical or Bayesian framework\n\n\nInformation\n\nThe starting point for any regression problem is data on an outcome variable y and one or more predictors x.\nInformation should be available on what data were observed at all\nWe typically have prior knowledge coming from sources other than the data at hand. Where local data are weak it would be foolish to draw conclusions without using prior knowledge\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nThree sorts of assumptions that are essential to any regression model of an outcome y given predictors x.\n\nThe functional form of the relation between x and y\nWhere the data comes from (strongest assumptions tend to be simple and easy to understand, weaker assumptions, being more general, can also be more complicated)\nReal-world relevance of the measured data\n\nThe interpretation of a regression of y on x depends also on the relation between the measured x and the underlying predictors of interest, and on the relation between the measured y and the underlying outcomes of interest\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical inference\nThe traditional approach to statistical analysis is based on summarizing the information in the data, not using prior information, but getting estimates and predictions that have well-understood statistical properties, low bias and low variance.\nUnbiasedness: estimates should be true on average\nCoverage: confidence intervals should cover the true parameter value 95% of the time\nConservatism: sometimes data are weak and we can’t make strong statements, but we’d like to be able to say, at least approximately, that our estimates are unbiased and our intervals have the advertised coverage.\nIn classical statistics there should be a clear and unambiguous (“objective”) path from data to inferences, which in turn should be checkable, at least in theory, based on their frequency properties.\n\n\nBayesian inference\nIncorporates prior information into inferences, going beyond the goal of merely summarizing existing data. The analysis gives more reasonable results and can be used to make direct predictions about future outcomes and about the results of future experiments.\nThe prior distribution represents the arena over which any predictions will be evaluated.\nWe have a choice: classical inference, leading to pure summaries of data which can have limited value as predictions; or Bayesian inference, which in theory can yield valid predictions even with weak data, but relies on additional assumptions.\nAll Bayesian inferences are probabilistic and thus can be represented by random simulations. For this reason, whenever we want to summarize uncertainty in estimation beyond simple confidence intervals, and whenever we want to use regression models for predictions, we go Bayesian.\n\n\n\n1.6 Computing least squares and Bayesian regression\nIn general, we recommend using Bayesian inference for regression\n\nIf prior information is available, you can use it\nif not, Bayesian regression with weakly informative default priors still has the advantage of yielding stable estimates and producing simulations that enable you to express inferential and predictive uncertainty (estimates with uncertainties and probabilistic predictions or forecasts)\n\nBayesian regression in R:\nfit <- stan_glm(y ~ x, data=mydata)\n\n# stan_glm can run slow for large datasets, make it faster by running in optimizing mode\nfit <- stan_glm(y ~ x, data=mydata, algorithm=\"optimizing\")\nleast squares regression (classical statistics)\nfit <- lm(y ~ x, data=mydata)\nBayesian and simulation approaches become more important when fitting regularized regression and multilevel models.\n\n\n1.8 Exercises\nIt took me 8-9 days to complete the 10 exercises at the end of this chapter. A few observations:\n\nExperiment design, even with simple paper helicopters, still requires time, effort and attention to detail. Even then, a well thought out and executed plan can still end up with uninspiring results. It is therefore the process of experimentation and not the result where I learned the most. It was important to continue experimentation (as it resulted in finding a high-performing copter) even after my initial approach didn’t seem to work as I had thought it would.\nFinding good and bad examples of research is hard on your own! I relied on others existing work where they explicitly called out (and explained) good and bad research, sometimes with great detail, in order to answer exercises 1.7 and 1.8.\nThink about the problem in real life! I don’t know if my answer to 1.9 is correct, but it helped to think about the physical phenomenon that was taking place (a helicopter falling through air, pulled by gravity) in order to come up with a better model fit than the example provided. I found that thinking of physical constraints of the real world problem helped narrow the theoretical model form.\nPick something you’re interested in and is worth your while! For exercise 1.10, the dataset I have chosen is the NFL Play-by-Play dataset, as I’m already working on a separate project where I’ll be practicing writing SQL queries to analyze the data. Play-by-play data going back to 1999 will provide me with ample opportunities to pursue different modeling choices. My interest in football will keep me dedicated through the tough times."

The main bottleneck was learning how to calculate proportions based on weighted estimates. Once that took shape, I was able to figure out how to present the data visually in a way that resembles the authors’ approach.\nThe figure “Ideology by Income Levels” shows that the proportion of political liberals, moderates, and conservatives is about the same for all income levels. The figure “Party Identification by Income Levels” shows a strong relation between income and Republican partisanship, at least as of 2008. The partisanship and ideology example is a reminder that even very similar measures can answer quite different questions.\n\n\n\n2.2 Validity and reliability\nData analysis reaches a dead end if we have poor data.\nTwo reasons for discussing measurement:\n\nwe need to understand what our data actually mean, otherwise we cannot extract the right information\nlearning about accuracy, reliability and validity will set a foundation for understanding variance, correlation, and error, which will be useful in setting up linear models in the forthcoming chapters\n\nThe property of being precise enough is a combination of the properties of the scale and what we are trying to use it for.\nIn social science, the way to measure what we are trying to measure is not as transparent as it is in everyday life.\nOther times, the thing we are trying to measure is pretty straightforward, but a little bit fuzzy, and the ways to tally it up aren’t obvious.\nSometimes we are trying to measure something that we all agree has meaning, but which is subjective for every person and does not correspond to a “thing” we can count or measure with a ruler.\nAttitudes are private; you can’t just weigh them or measure their widths.\nIt can be helpful to take multiple measurements on an underlying construct of interest.\n\nValidity\nA measure is valid to the degree that it represents what you are trying to measure. Asking people how satisfied they are with some government service might not be considered a valid measure of the effectiveness of that service.\nValid measures are ones in which there is general agreement that the observations are closely related to the intended construct.\nvalidity: the property of giving the right answer on average across a wide range of plausible scenarios. To study validity in an empirical way, ideally you want settings in which there is an observable true value and multiple measurements can be taken.\n\n\nReliability\nA reliable measure is one that is precise and stable. We would hope the variability in our sample is due to real differences among people or things, and not due to random error incurred during the measurement process.\n\n\nSample selection\nselection: the idea that the data you see may be a nonrepresentative sample of a larger population you will not see.\nIn addition to selection bias, there are also biases from nonresponse to particular survey items, partially observed measurements, and choices in coding and interpretation of data.\n\n\n\n2.3 All graphs are comparisons\n\nSimple scatterplots\n\nhealth_data_path = file.path(data_root_path, \"HealthExpenditure/data/healthdata.txt\")\nhealth <- read.table(health_data_path, header=TRUE)\nDT::datatable(head(health))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mgp=c(1.7,.5,0), tck=-.01, mar=c(3,3,.1,.1))\nggplot(data=health, aes(x=spending, y=lifespan, label=country)) +\n  geom_text() + \n  labs(x=\"Health care spending (PPP US$)\",y=\"Life expectancy (years)\") + \n  theme(\n    panel.border = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill=NA, size=1),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'white'),\n    aspect.ratio = 0.5\n  ) \n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the exceptional position of the United States (highest health care spending, low life expectancy) and also shows the relation between spending and lifespan in other countries.\n\n\nDisplaying more information on the graph\nAt least in theory, you can display five variables easily with a scatterplot:\n\nx position\ny position\nsymbol\nsymbol size\nsymbol color\n\nWe prefer clearly distinguishable colors or symbols such as open circles, solid circles, crosses and dots. When a graph has multiple lines, label them directly.\n\n\nMultiple plots\nLooking at data in unexpected ways can lead to discovery.\nWe can learn by putting multiple related graphs in a single display.\nThere is no single best way to display a dataset.\nIn the code chunks below I’ll recreate plots 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 using their code provided in the supplemental website.\n\nallnames_path = file.path(data_root_path, \"Names/data/allnames_clean.csv\")\nallnames <- read.csv(allnames_path)\nDT::datatable(head(allnames), options=list(scrollX=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# create a vector identifying which rows have Female names (TRUE) and which have Male names (FALSE)\ngirl <- as.vector(allnames$sex) == \"F\"\n\n# Since there is a `names` base R function, I'm renaming the names vector to names_vec\nnames_vec <- as.vector(allnames$name)\n\n\n# plot data\n\n# calculate the number of characters in each name\nnamelength <- nchar(names_vec)\n\n# create a vector of last letters of each name\nlastletter <- substr(names_vec, namelength, namelength)\n\n# create a vector of first letters of each name\nfirstletter <- substr(names_vec, 1, 1)\n\n# plotting function\n# i am renaming it to names_histogram since there is an `arm` package function called `discrete.histogram`\nnames_histogram <- function(x, prob, prob2=NULL, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"Probability\", xaxs.label=NULL, yaxs.label=NULL, bar.width=NULL, ...) {\n  if (length(x) != length(prob)) stop()\n  \n  x.values <- sort (unique(x))\n  n.x.values <- length (x.values)\n  gaps <- x.values[2:n.x.values] -

You should display precision in a way that respects the uncertainty and variability in the numbers being presented. It makes sense to save lots of digits for intermediate steps in computations.\nYou can often make a list or table of numbers more clear by first subtracting out the average (or for a table, row and column averages).\nA graph can almost always be made smaller than you think and still be readable. This then leaves room for more plots on a grid, which then allows more patterns to be seen at once and compared.\nNever display a graph you can’t talk about. Give a full caption for every graph (this explains to yourself and others what you are trying to show and what you have learned from each plot).\nAvoid displaying graphs that have been made simply because they are conventional.\n\n\nGraphics for understanding statistical models\nThree uses of graphs in statistical analysis:\n\nDisplays of raw data. Exploratory analysis.\nGraphs of fitted models and inferences (and simulated data).\nGraphs presenting your final results.\n\nThe goal of any graph is communication to self and others. Graphs are comparisons: to zero, to other graphs, to horizontal lines, and so forth. The unexpected is usually not an “outlier” or aberrant point but rather a systematic pattern in some part of the data.\n\n\nGraphs as comparisons\nWhen making a graph, line things up so that the most important comparisons are clearest.\n\n\nGraphs of fitted models\nIt can be helpful to graph a fitted model and data on the same plot. Another use of graphics with fitted models is to plot predicted datasets and compare them visually to actual data.\n\n\n\n2.4 Data and adjustment: trends in mortality rates\nAggregation bias: occurs when it is wrongly assumed that the trends seen in aggregated data also apply to individual data points.\nI referenced this Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services page to learn more about how to calculate age-adjusted death rates.\nIn the following code chunks I’ll recreate Figures 2.11 and 2.12 using their code provided on the supplemental website.\n\n# deaton <- read.table(root(\"AgePeriodCohort/data\",\"deaton.txt\"), header=TRUE)\nages_all <- 35:64\nages_decade <- list(35:44, 45:54, 55:64)\nyears_1 <- 1999:2013\nmort_data <- as.list(rep(NA,3))\ngroup_names <- c(\"Non-Hispanic white\", \"Hispanic white\", \"African American\")\n\nfpath_1 <- file.path(data_root_path, \"AgePeriodCohort/data\", \"white_nonhisp_death_rates_from_1999_to_2013_by_sex.txt\")\nfpath_2 <- file.path(data_root_path, \"AgePeriodCohort/data\", \"white_hisp_death_rates_from_1999_to_2013_by_sex.txt\")\nfpath_3 <- file.path(data_root_path, \"AgePeriodCohort/data\", \"black_death_rates_from_1999_to_2013_by_sex.txt\")\nmort_data[[1]] <- read.table(fpath_1, header=TRUE)\nmort_data[[2]] <- read.table(fpath_2, header=TRUE)\nmort_data[[3]] <- read.table(fpath_3, header=TRUE)\n\n\nDT::datatable(mort_data[[1]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraw_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\nmale_raw_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\nfemale_raw_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\navg_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\nmale_avg_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\nfemale_avg_death_rate <- array(NA, c(length(years_1), 3, 3))\n\n# k represents the 3 different race/ethnicity groups\nfor (k in 1:3){\n  data <- mort_data[[k]]\n  \n  # the Male column is 0 for Female, 1 for Male\n  male <- data[,\"Male\"]==1\n  \n  # j represents the 3 different age decades\n  # 35:44, 45:54, 55:64\n  for (j in 1:3){\n    # years1 is from 1999 to 2013\n    for (i in 1:length(years_1)){\n      ok <- data[,\"Year\"]==years_1[i] & data[,\"Age\"] %in% ages_decade[[j]]\n      \n      # raw death rate calculated as\n      # 100,000 * deaths / population\n      raw_death_rate[i,j,k] <- 1e5*sum(data[ok,\"Deaths\"])/sum(data[ok,\"Population\"])\n      male_raw_death_rate[i,j,k] <- 1e5*sum(data[ok&male,\"Deaths\"])/sum(data[ok&male,\"Population\"])\n      female_raw_death_rate[i,j,k] <- 1e5*sum(data[ok&!male,\"Deaths\"])/sum(data[ok&!male,\"Population\"])\n      avg_death_rate[i,j,k] <- mean(data[ok,\"Rate\"])\n      male_avg_death_rate[i,j,k] <- mean(data[ok&male,\"Rate\"])\n      female_avg_death_rate[i,j,k] <- mean(data[ok&!male,\"Rate\"])\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\npar(mar=c(2.5, 3, 3, .2), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)\nplot(range(years_1), c(1, 1.1), xaxt=\"n\", yaxt=\"n\", type=\"n\", bty=\"l\", xaxs=\"i\", xlab=\"\", ylab=\"Death rate relative to 1999\", main=\"Age-adjusted death rates for non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54:\\nTrends for women and men\")\nlines(years_1, male_avg_death_rate[,2,1]/male_avg_death_rate[1,2,1], col=\"blue\")\nlines(years_1, female_avg_death_rate[,2,1]/female_avg_death_rate[1,2,1], col=\"red\")\naxis(1, seq(1990,2020,5))\naxis(2, seq(1, 1.1, .05))\ntext(2011.5, 1.075, \"Women\", col=\"red\")\ntext(2010.5, 1.02, \"Men\", col=\"blue\")\ngrid(col=\"gray\")\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_age_45_54 <- function(yr){\n  ages <- 45:54\n  ok <- births$year %in% (yr -

My grid lines are at different placements (5 years and 0.025 death rate) than the textbook but I’m happy with how the plot turned out. One hiccup that needed to be addressed was that the group aesthetic needs to be discrete (it was integer 1 for Male and integer 0 for Female) in order to use scale_color_manual.\nNext, I’ll recreate Figure 2.11b (increase in average age of this group as the baby boom generation moves through).\n\navg_age_data <- mort_data2 %>% group_by(\n  Year,\n  Age\n) %>% summarise(\n  total_pop = sum(Population)\n) %>% mutate(\n  # calculated weighted mean\n  weighted_age = Age * total_pop\n) %>% group_by(\n  # in order to calculate weighted mean age by Year, \n  # group only by Year\n  Year\n) %>% summarize(\n  weighted_mean_age = sum(weighted_age) / sum(total_pop)\n)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Jason Kelce standing on the sideline, with his helmet in hand, watching the Eagles lose against the Bucs on Monday Night Football\n\n\n\nI saw a reel on Instagram by an autistic woman who said that in order to process emotions we have to communicate them. In this blog post, I communicate some of my emotions around the 2023 Philadelphia Eagles team and season.\nIt’s been 48-ish hours since the Eagles lost 9-32 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday Night Football in the last game of Super Wild Card Weekend, finishing the season 1-6 after a 10-1 start.\nIf you’ve spent anytime with Eagles fans, you’ll probably have come across the fact that no matter how much fans of other teams hate the Eagles, you don’t hate them as much as we do. Why? Well, it’s a different reason every season.\nIn 2023, I had high expectations for the Eagles. I didn’t expect us to win the Super Bowl, but I started the season expecting them to win two playoff games. If we got the 1-seed, I expected the team to get to the Super Bowl. If we had to play a Wild Card game, I expected us to get to the NFCCG. Yes, that’s still a lofty goal, but that’s what NFL expectations are.\nAnd there was good reason to have those expectations—Hurts was an MVP candidate and outplayed Mahomes in the Super Bowl. The Eagles had put up 24 points by halftime (before a defensive collapse with Gannon daydreaming about the weather in Glendale). If Bradberry didn’t tug on Smith-Schuster’s jersey (or if the refs ate the flag), if Quez didn’t drop the ball, or if Jalen didn’t fumble, it might have flipped to a three or four point win. The expectations were so high that, I’m embarrased to admit, I thought the departure of both coordinators would be good for the team because the offense did not have any systematic answers to pressure, and the defensive system couldn’t seem to adjust to good offenses. I thought losing T.J. Edwards or C.J. Gardner-Johnson wouldn’t matter.\nStarting the 2023 season at 10-1, there was evidence that these expectations seemed reasonable: we beat the Chiefs on the road, and the Bills, Dolphins and Cowboys at home. All four of them playoff teams, three of them division winners. After 11 games, the Eagles were 6-0 (3-0 on the road) against teams who would eventually make the playoffs (@ Bucs, @ Rams, Dolphins, Cowboys, @ Chiefs, Bills).\nThe first halves of those 11 games weren’t always great (at halftime, the Eagles were down 4 and 7 vs Commanders, down 3 to Cowboys, down 10 to Chiefs, and down 10 to Bills). But some of the second halves were amazing (shutting out the Rams in LA and the Chiefs in KC, holding the Dolphins to 7, and Dallas to 6). Jalen set the record for comeback wins (6) after being down double digits, had 13 straight wins against teams with a winning record, and was 25-2 in his last 27 games. The Eagles had the toughest schedule coming into the 2023 season, and we all know you have to gut it out sometimes, so this was just a testament to the team’s grit.\nAnd then, somebody pulled the plug.\nThe Eagles lost to the Bucs in the Wild Card when, in Week 12, during pregame warm-ups, seemingly every player on the entire 49ers roster intentionally bumped into James Bradberry IV as they walked past him. And not a single Eagles player or coach stood up to defend him. Not Slay, nor Blankenship, nor Fletch, nor BG, nor Kelce, Lane, AJ, Smitty, nor Hurts. Not even Big Dom. And not even after months of Deebo calling Bradberry trash. Watching that felt like somebody pulled the plug, and the screen went blank.\nI was at the game in Seattle (which, btw, was my first time ever going to an NFL game) when Drew Lock went on a 92-yard TD drive to put on for his team. Jalen and the offense couldn’t respond. Whether they were trying to draw a flag, or the players went rogue, the magic that I felt in the first 11 weeks (sans the Jets game) had fully evaporated.\nI don’t need to repeat the rest of the season in detail—scraping by the Giants at home, losing to Gannon and the Cardinals after putting up 31 points, getting blown out in East Rutherford while losing AJ and Sydney Brown to that godforsaken turf—which was an epic collapse of what felt like historical proportions (e.g., the Eagles ending with the worst point differential in NFL history after starting 10-1). Every week felt like being punched in the gut. The entire apartment stunk of my crummy vibe while watching the Eagles get punked by teams, both greater and lesser than them. The day after each game was uncomfortable, full of angst, anger, and self-loathing comedic relief on Eagles Twitter. My mental health will significantly improve this offseason, and not in some figurative, intangible way.\nI think Nick Sirianni deserves a shot to fix this. Based on reports today about him and Howie shopping coordinators, it seems like he will get that shot. It will take me some time to get over the demotion of Sean Desai (if Nick gets a chance to fix this 11-7, Wild Card losing, no-hot-route, no-middle-of-the-field-route, only-run-Swift-4-times-in-the-first-half mess, why didn’t Desai get a shot to get out of a rut at 10-3?) And based on the (lack of) planning that went into the last 8 weeks, extrapolating that into the offseason doesn’t make me optimistic.\nAnd yet, what if Nick figures this out? What if he gets the right people on his staff and listens to them? What if he overhauls his offensive system and puts into place simple, common elements that get his receivers separation more easily and gives Hurts the ability to make pre-snap adjustments based on what he sees? What if that opens up the run game again? What if Jalen Carter, Reed Blankenship and Kelee Ringo take the next step? What if Howie invests in the Linebacker and Safety positions? What if all three layers of the defense work as one unit to get the right angles and tackle hard? What if Sirianni turns this things around and wins Coach of the Year next season?\nWhat if he doesn’t? What if Hurts starts to absorb these bad habits that they force him into with their system and scheme? What if we lose AJ’s prime? What if Kelce comes back to a rebuild year with a roster capable of winning a Super Bowl?\nWhat saved the season for me, with seemingly nothing left to save, was the heart with which DeVonta played in the Wild Card loss. He was putting his body on the line, he was running clean routes, blowing by dudes, going up for the ball and then coming down with it. He was fired up on the sideline. He didn’t care that they had lost 5 out of 6 and were down two scores on the road. He was a true WR1 that night. So, I’ll take that energy with me into the offseason. If it works out, that’s great. If not, it will suck. Again.\nRegardless, Go Birds."

Compare your results to the private leaderboard.\n\nI’ll use the dataset from the Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate) competition, and work through each section in the chapter.\n\nIn this competition, Zillow is asking you to predict the log-error between their Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home. The log error is defined as \\(logerror = log(Zestimate)-log(SalePrice)\\). Submissions are evaluated on Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log error and the actual log error.\n\nI get the following results by the end of the exercise:\n\n\n\nModel\nMean Absolute Error\n\n\n\n\nRandom Forest\n0.072\n\n\nNeural Net\n0.117\n\n\nEnsemble of both\n0.086\n\n\n\nThe first place entry on the private leaderboard had an error of 0.074."

good\nto.train.y[:5]\n\n0    0.0276\n1   -0.1684\n2   -0.0040\n3    0.0218\n4   -0.0050\nName: logerror, dtype: float32\n\n\n\nxs,y = to.train.xs, to.train.y\nvalid_xs, valid_y = to.valid.xs, to.valid.y\n\n\nm = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=4)\nm.fit(xs,y);\n\n\ndraw_tree(m, xs, size=10, leaves_parallel=True, precision=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smallest average logerror value in this model is when finishedsquarefeet12 (which according to their data dictionary is the “Finished living area”) is greater than 337, which is for 85645 rows which is basically the whole training set.\n\nView the Data for Outliers\nAs done in the book, I’ll look at a sample of the data and visualize it in more detail:\n\nsamp_idx = np.random.permutation(len(y))[:500]\n\nviz_model=dtreeviz.model(m,\n                         X_train=xs.iloc[samp_idx],\n                         y_train=y.iloc[samp_idx],\n                         feature_names=xs.columns,\n                         target_name=dep_var)\n\nviz_model.view(fontname='DejaVu Sans', scale=1.6, label_fontsize=10,\n               orientation='LR', fancy=False)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/base.py:439: UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but DecisionTreeRegressor was fitted with feature names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, since such a large portion of the data falls into the split of finishedsquarefeet12 &gt; 337, the visualization is not helpful as there are 0 or just a few values left for the other splits even at larger sample sizes (I tried 500, 1000 and 5000).\nAs done in the text, I’ll now build a bigger tree without passing it any stopping criteria, and create a loss function (mean absolute error) to match the competition:\n\nm = DecisionTreeRegressor()\nm.fit(xs,y);\n\n\ndef mae(pred, y): return (pred - y).abs().mean()\ndef m_mae(m, xs, y): return mae(m.predict(xs), y)\n\nHere’s the mean absolute error on the training set:\n\nm_mae(m, xs, y)\n\n0.0\n\n\nHere’s the mean absolute error on the validation set:\n\nm_mae(m, valid_xs, valid_y)\n\n0.15422440832733592\n\n\nThe validation error is much larger than the training set error because the model is overfitting! As was the case in the textbook, the reason is that we have almost as many leaf nodes as we do training sample. It’s basically memorizing the training set.\n\nm.get_n_leaves(), len(xs)\n\n(83323, 85670)\n\n\nI’ll use the same stopping criteria as the text (every leaf node should contain at least 25 rows) and create a new model:\n\nm = DecisionTreeRegressor(min_samples_leaf=25)\nm.fit(to.train.xs, to.train.y)\nm_mae(m, xs, y), m_mae(m, valid_xs, valid_y)\n\n(0.07031707298053898, 0.08723056533912212)\n\n\nThe validation and training set errors are now similar.\n\nm.get_n_leaves(), m.get_n_leaves()/len(xs)\n\n(2688, 0.03137621104237189)\n\n\nWe now have about 3% as many leaves as we do training samples."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nRestaurant-bought wings are pricey. Even fast-food bought wings, which can be miserably made some times—I once bought advertised Honey BBQ Chicken Wings which were great the first time, but the second time looked like plain wings with barbeque sauce drizzled over them–were about $20 for 16 wings. I don’t mind the price, gratefully, but I do mind consistent quality and want to avoide letdowns, so I chose to learn how to make wings. I also need to fill the gap caused by the lack of NFL and College Football during the offseason, so this is a tasty project which serves that purpose as well.\n\n\nFirst Attempt\nI made my first batch of chicken wings on Saturday, February 11, 2023. They were edible and the sauce was delicious. But they were at most a 5/10. I follow some recipe I found online after a google search which went something like:\n\nPreheat oven to 400°F\nBaste oil on both sides of the wings and season with salt and pepper\nBake for 20 minutes, flipping the wings after 10 minutes\nHeat the oven to 425°F\nBaste on the sauce and bake for 7 minutes then flip. Repeat a few times.\nBroil (500°F) for 5-10 minutes.\n\nMy sauce was made of Ray’s sugar-free BBQ sauce, mustard, soy sauce, and honey.\nI did not have a basting brush and was using a spoon to lather on the sauce. It did not work well. Also, the meat did not fall off the bones and it took more effort than worthwhile to eat them.\n\n\nSecond Attempt\nI was hungrier this time I suppose because I chose to make honey bbq drumsticks instead of wings. This time I got a silicone basting brush at Safeway. I modified my approach slightly:\n\nPreheat oven to 400°F\nActually baste this time and season the drumsticks\nBake on one side for 15 minutes, flip and bake for another 15 minutes\nRemove the drumsticks and heat the oven to 425°F\nRepeat four times, twice on each side: baste on sauce, bake for 7 minutes, remove and flip.\nAdd coconut flour to the sauce (note to self: use rice flour instead)\nRepeat two times, once on each side: baste on sauce/flour mix (gravy?), bake for 7 minutes and flip.\nBroil (500°F) for 5 minutes.\n\nUsing the basting brush allowed for a more even distribution of sauce on the drumsticks. The skin still wasn’t crispy enough, although the meat was (more) easily coming off the bones and was juicy + delicious.\nWhen I make it again, probably next weekend, I’ll switch back to chicken wings and find a new recipe which emphasizes the cripsiness of the wings.\n\n\n\nclose-up of my honey bbq chicken drumsticks with a few charred spots."

If it’s not, I’ll press “Incorrect” and is_correct will stay 0.\n\n#install gradio (quick fix for install error on colab)\nimport locale\nlocale.getpreferredencoding = lambda: \"UTF-8\"\n!pip install -q gradio\n\nI’ll load the three CSVs (each with responses for 3 prompting styles across 20 questions from each model) into a single DataFrame, and sort it by the question column so it’s easier for me to grade the responses.\n\nimport gradio as gr, pandas as pd\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndfs = []\nfiles = ['llama2_responses.csv', 'mistral_responses.csv', 'zephyr_responses.csv']\n\nfor file in files:\n  df = pd.read_csv(file)\n  df = df.drop('Unnamed: 0', axis=1)\n  df['is_correct'] = 0\n  dfs.append(df)\n\ndf = pd.concat(dfs, axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n\n# sort by question so it's easier to grade\ndf = df.sort_values(by=['question'])\ndf = df.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndataset\nquestion\nmodel\nprompting_style\nresponse\nis_correct\n\n\n\n\n0\nCoin Flip\n'A coin is heads up.

I’ll modify the existing get_text function, which takes an index and returns a concatenated string.\nThe label function is called when the user clicks either of the buttons. If the button clicked has a value of \"Correct\" then the choice parameter will be \"correct\" and the is_correct column will be set to 1. The label function returns the next index and string to display.\n\ndef get_text(idx):\n    \"\"\" Combine the question and answer into a single string \"\"\"\n    global df\n    text = 'Q: ' + df.iloc[idx]['question'] + '\\n\\nA: ' + df.iloc[idx]['response']\n\n    return text\n\ndef label(idx, choice='correct'):\n    \"\"\" Set `is_correct` column to `1` if response is correct \"\"\"\n    if choice == 'correct':\n        df.loc[idx, 'is_correct'] = 1\n    return idx+1, get_text(idx+1) # Move on to next one\n\nIn order to avoid the gradio app from timing out, I have called queue on the demo object before I launch it.\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    starting_idx = 0\n    with gr.Column():\n        idx = gr.Slider(value=starting_idx, label=\"idx\") # Progress bar, borrowed the idea from https://www.kaggle.com/code/nbroad/create-science-wikipedia-dataset\n        text = gr.Textbox(value=get_text(0), label=\"text\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        correct_btn = gr.Button(value=\"Correct\")\n        incorrect_btn = gr.Button(value=\"Incorrect\")\n\n    correct_btn.click(fn=partial(label, choice='correct'), inputs=[idx], outputs=[idx, text])\n    incorrect_btn.click(fn=partial(label, choice='incorrect'), inputs=[idx], outputs=[idx, text])\n\n#demo.launch(debug=True, show_error=True)\ndemo.queue().launch(share=True, show_error=True)\n\nHere is an example of what the gradio app looks like:\n\n\n\nA screenshot of my gradio app used to grade LLM responses\n\n\n\ndf.to_csv('graded_responses.csv', index=False)"

RISE turnes your notebook into a presentation.\nGenerally speaking, if it’s something that a human can do reasonably quickly, even an expert human (like look at a Go board and decide if it’s a good board or not) then that’s probably something that deep learning will probably be good at. If it’s something that takes logical thought process over time, particularly if it’s not based on much data, deep learning probably won’t do that well.\nThe first neural network was built in 1957. The basic ideas have not changed much at all.\nWhat’s going on in these models?\n\nArthur Samuel in late 1950s invented Machine Learning.\nNormal program: input -&gt; program -&gt; results.\nMachine Learning model: input and weights (parameters) -&gt; model -&gt; results.\n\nThe model is a mathematical function that takes the input, multiplies them with one set of weights and adds them up, then does that again for a second set of weights, and so forth.\nIt takes all of the negative numbers and replaces them with 0.\nIt takes all those numbers as inputs to the next layer.\nAnd it repeats a few times.\n\nWeights start out as being random.\nA more useful workflow: input/weights -&gt; model -&gt; results -&gt; loss -&gt; update weights.\nThe loss is a number that says how good the results were.\nWe need a way to come up with a new set of weights that are a bit better than the current weights.\n“bit better” weights means it makes the loss a bit better.\nIf we make it a little bit better a few times, it’ll eventually get good.\nNeural nets proven to solve any computable function (i.e. it’s flexible enough to update weights until the results are good).\n“Generate artwork based on someone’s twitter bio” is a computable function.\nOnce we’ve finished the training procedure we don’t the loss and the weights can be integrated into the model.\nWe end up with inputs -&gt; model -&gt; results which looks like our original idea of a program.\nDeploying a model will have lots of tricky details but there will be one line of code which says learn.predict which takes an input and provides results.\nThe most important thing to do is experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Your Deep Learning Journey In this section, I’ll take notes while I read Chapter 1 in the textbook.\n\n\n\nWhat you don’t need for deep learning: lots of math, lots of data, lots of expensive computers.\nDeep learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data by using multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to perform a specified task.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts developed a mathematical model of an artificial neuron in 1943.\nMost of Pitt’s famous work was done while he was homeless.\nPsychologist Frank Rosenblatt further developed the artificial neuron to give it the ability to learn and built the first device that used these principles, the Mark I Perceptron, which was able to recognize simple shapes.\nMarvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book about the Perceptron and showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow the limitations of a single layer to be addressed.\nThe 1986 book Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) by David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group defined PDP as requiring the following:\n\nA set of processing units.\nA state of activation.\nAn output function for each unit.\nA pattern of connectivity among units.\nA propogation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities.\nAn activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit.\nA learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience.\nAn environment within which the system must operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of deep learning is artisanal: how do you know if you’ve got enough data, whether it is in the right format, if your model is training properly, and, if it’s not, what you should do about it?\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'\n\ndef is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\n    path,\n    get_image_files(path),\n    valid_pct=0.2,\n    seed=42,\n    label_func=is_cat,\n    item_tfms=Resize(224)\n)\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [811712512/811706944 00:11&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(1)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/fastai/vision/learner.py:288: UserWarning: `cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\n  warn(\"`cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\")\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future.

His basic idea was this: instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples of the problem to solve, and let it figure out how to solve it itself.\nIn 1961 his checkers-playing program had learned so much that it beat the Connecticut state champion.\nWeights are just variables and a weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables.\nThe program’s inputs are values that it processes in order to produce its results (for instance, taking image pixels as inputs, and returning the classification “dog” as a result).\nBecause the weights affect the program, they are in a sense another kind of input.\nA program using weight assignment: inputs and weights -&gt; model -&gt; results.\nA model is a special kind of program, on that can do many different things depending on the weights.\nWeights = parameters, with the term “weights” reserved for a particulat type of model parameter.\nLearning would become entirely automatic when the adjustment of the weights was also automatic.\nTraining a maching learning model: inputs and weights -&gt; model -&gt; results -&gt; performance -&gt; update weights.\nresults are different than the performance of a model.\nUsing a trained model as a program -&gt; inputs -&gt; model -&gt; results.\nmaching learning is the training of programs developed by allowing a computer to learn from its experience, rather than through manually coding the individual steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeural networks is a mathematical function that can solve any problem to any level of accuracy.\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a completely general way to update the weights of a neural network, to make it improve at any given task.\nImage classification problem:\n\nOur inputs are the images.\nOur weights are the weights in the neural net.\nOur model is a neural net.\nOur results are the values that are calculated by the neural net, like “dog” or “cat”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functional form of the model is called its architecture.\nThe weights are called parameters.\nThe predictions are calculated from the independent variable, which is the data not including the labels.\nThe results or the model are called predictions.\nThe measure of performance is called the loss.\nThe loss depends not only on the predictions, but also on the correct labels (also known as targets or the dependent variable).\nDetailed training loop: inputs and parameters -&gt; architecture -&gt; predictions (+ labels) -&gt; loss -&gt; update parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nA model cannot be created without data.\nA model can learn to operate on only the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\nThis learning approach creates only predictions, not recommended actions.\nIt’s not enough to just have examples of input data, we need labels for that data too.\nPositive feedback loop: the more the model is used, the more biased the data becomes, making the model even more biased, and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_tfms are applied to each item while batch_tfms are applied to a batch of items at a time using the GPU.\nA classification model attempts to predict a class, or category.\nA regression model is one that attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as temperature or location.\nThe parameter seed=42 sets the random seed to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it. This way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\nWe care about how well our model works on previously unseen images.\nThe longer you train for, the better your accuracy will get on the training set; the validation set accuracy will also improve for a while, but eventually it will start getting worse as the model starts to memorize the training set rather than finding generalizable underlying patterns in the data. When this happens, we say that the model is overfitting.\nOverfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training for all machine learning practitioners, and all algorithms.\nYou should only use methods to avoid overfitting after you have confirmed that overfitting is occurring (i.e., if you have observed the validation accuracy getting worse during training)\nfastai defaults to valid_pct=0.2.\nModels using architectures with more layers take longer to train and are more prone to overfitting, on the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\nA metric is a function that measures the quality of the model’s predictions using the validation set.\nerror_rate tells you what percentage of inputs in the validation set are being classified incorrectly.\naccuracy = 1.0 - error_rate.\nThe entire purpose of loss is to define a “measure of performance” that the training system can use to update weights automatically. A good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand.\nA model that has weights that have already been trained on another dataset is called a pretrained model.\nWhen using a pretrained model, cnn_learner will remove the last layer and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights. This last part of the model is known as the head.\nUsing a pretrained model for a task different from what is was originally trained for is known as transfer learning.\nThe architecture only describes a template for a mathematical function; it doesn’t actually do anything until we provide values for the millions of parameters it contains.\nTo fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of epochs).\nfit will fit a model (i.e., look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels).\nFine-Tuning: a transfer learning technique that updates the parameters of a pretrained model by training for additional epochs using a different task from that used for pretraining.\nfine_tune has a few parameters you can set, but in the default form it does two steps:\n\nUse one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to get the new random head to work correctly with your dataset.\nUse the number of epochs requested when calling the method to fit the entire model, updating the weights of the later layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers (which don’t require many changes from the pretrained weights).\n\nThe head of the model is the part that is newly added to be specific to the new dataset.\nAn epoch is one complete pass through the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we fine tune our pretrained models, we adapt what the last layers focus on to specialize on the problem at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of things can be represented as images.\nSound can be converted to a spectogram.\nTimes series data can be created into an image using Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF).\nIf the human eye can recognize categories from the images, then a deep learning model should be able to do so too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nLabel\nThe data that we’re trying to predict\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe template of the model that we’re trying to fit; i.e., the actual mathematical function that we’re passing the input data and parameters to\n\n\nModel\nThe combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters\n\n\nParameters\nThe values in the model that change what task it can do and that are updated through model training\n\n\nFit\nUpdate the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels\n\n\nTrain\nA synonym for fit\n\n\nPretrained Model\nA model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned\n\n\nFine-tune\nUpdate a pretrained model for a different task\n\n\nEpoch\nOne complete pass through the input data\n\n\nLoss\nA measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via SGD\n\n\nMetric\nA measurement of how good the model is using the validation set, chosen for human consumption\n\n\nValidation set\nA set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is\n\n\nTraining set\nThe data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set\n\n\nOverfitting\nTraining a model in such a way that it remembers specific features of the input data, rather than generalizing wel to data not seen during training\n\n\nCNN\nConvolutional neural network; a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation\nNatural language processing (see below)\nTabular (see Adults income classification above)\nCollaborative filtering (see MovieLens ratings predictor above)\nStart by using one of the cut-down dataset versions and later scale up to the full-size version. This is how the world’s top practitioners do their modeling in practice; they do most of their experimentation and prototyping with subsets of their data, and use the full dataset only when they have a good understanding of what they have to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the model makes an accurate prediction for a data item, that should be because it has learned characteristics of that kind of item, and not because the model has been shaped by actually having seen that particular item.\nHyperparameters: various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors.\nWe, as modelers, are evaluating the model by looking at predictions on the validation data when we decide to explore new hyperparameter values and we are in danger of overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.\nThe test set can be used only to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts.\nTraining data is fully exposed to training and modeling processes, validation data is less exposed and test data is fully hidden.\nThe test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy.\nThe discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest.\nIt’s a good idea for you to try out a simple baseline model yourself, so you know what a really simply model can achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key property of the validation and test sets is that they must be representative of the new data you will see in the future.\nAs an example, for time series data, use earlier dates for training set and later more recent dates as validation set\nThe data you will be making predictions for in production may be qualitatively different from the data you have to train your model with.\n\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\n\n# I'm using IMDB_SAMPLE instead of the full IMDB dataset since it either takes too long or\n# I get a CUDA Out of Memory error if the batch size is more than 16 for the full dataset\n# Using a batch size of 16 with the sample dataset works fast\ndls = TextDataLoaders.from_csv(\n    path=untar_data(URLs.IMDB_SAMPLE),\n    csv_fname='texts.csv',\n    text_col=1,\n    label_col=0,\n    bs=16)\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\ncategory\n\n\n\n\n0\nxxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \\n\\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is\nnegative\n\n\n1\nxxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel -

What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n\nA validation set is a dataset upon which a model’s accuracy (or metrics in general) is calculated during training, as well as the dataset upon which the performance of different hyperparameters (like batch size and learning rate) are measured.\nA test set is a dataset upon which a model’s final performance is measured, a truly unseen dataset for both the model and the practitioner\n\nWhat will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set?\n\nSet aside a random 20% of the data as the validation set by default\n\nCan we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n\nNo, in situations where we want to ensure that the model’s accuracy is evaluated on data the model has not seen, we should not use a random validation set. Instead, we should create an intentional validation set. For example:\n\nFor time series data, use the most recent dates as the validation set\nFor human recognition data, use images of different people for training and validation sets\n\n\nWhat is overfitting? Provide an example.\n\nOverfitting is when a model memorizes features of the training dataset instead of learning generalizations of the features in the data. An example of this is when a model memorizes training data facial features but then cannot recognize different faces in the real world. Another example is when a model memorizes the handwritten digits in the training data, so it cannot then recognize digits written in different handwriting. Overfitting can be observed during training when the validation loss starts to increase as the training loss decreases.\n\nWhat is a metric? How does it differ from loss?\n\nA metric a measurement of how good a model is performing, chosen for human consumption. A loss is also a measurement of how good a model is performing, but it’s chosen to drive training using an optimizer.\n\nHow can pretrained models help?\n\nPretrained models are already good at recognizing many generalized features and so they can help by providing a set of weights in an architecture that are capable, reducing the amount of time you need to train a model specific to your task.\n\nWhat is the “head” of the model?\n\nThe last/top few neural network layers which are replaced with randomized weights in order to specialize your model via training on the task at hand (and not the task it was pretrained to perform).\n\nWhat kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?\n\nEarly layers: simple features lie lines, color gradients\nLater layers: compelx features like dog faces, outlines of people\n\nAre image models useful only for photos?\n\nNo! Lots of things can be represented by images so if you can represent something (like a sound) as an image (spectogram) and differences between classes/categories are easily recognizable by the human eye, you can train an image classifier to recognize it.\n\nWhat is an architecture?\n\nA template, mathematical function, to which you pass input data to in order to fit/train a model\n\nWhat is segmentation?\n\nRecognizing different objects in an image based on pixel colors (each object is a different pixel color)\n\nWhat is y_range used for? When do we need it?\n\nIt’s used to specify the output range of a regression model. We need it when the target is a continuous value.\n\nWhat are hyperparameters?\n\nModeling choices such as network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies and other higher level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters.\n\nWhat is the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?\n\nMaking sure you have good validation and test sets to evaluate the performance of a model on real world data.\nTrying out a simple baseline model to know what level of performance such a model can achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a GPU useful for deep learning? How is a CPU different, and why is it less effective for deep learning?\n\nCPU vs GPU for Machine Learning\n\nCPUs process tasks in a sequential manner, GPUs process tasks in parallel.\nGPUs can have thousands of cores, processing tasks at the same time.\nGPUs have many cores processing at low speeds, CPUs have few cores processing at high speeds.\nSome algorithms are optimized for CPUs rather than GPUs (time series data, recommendation systems that need lots of memory).\nNeural networks are designed to process tasks in parallel.\n\nCPU vs GPU in Machine Learning Algorithms: Which is Better?\n\nMachine Learning Operations Preferred on CPUs\n\nRecommendation systems that involve huge memory for embedding layers.\nSupport vector machines, time-series data, algorithms that don’t require parallel computing.\nRecurrent neural networks because they use sequential data.\nAlgorithms with intensive branching.\n\nMachine Learning Operations Preferred on GPUs\n\nOperations that involve parallelism.\n\n\nWhy Deep Learning Uses GPUs\n\nNeural networks are specifically made for running in parallel.\n\n\nTry to think of three areas where feedback loops might impact the use of machine learning. See if you can find documented examples of that happening in practice.\n\nHidden Risks of Machine Learning Applied to Healthcare: Unintended Feedback Loops Between Models and Future Data Causing Model Degradation\n\nIf clinicians fully trust the machine learning model (100% adoption of the predicted label) the false positive rate (FPR) grows uncontrollably with the number of updates.\n\nRunaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing\n\nOnce police are deployed based on these predictions, data from observations in the neighborhood is then used to further update the model.\nDiscovered crime data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process is repeated.\nPredictive policing systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.\n\nPitfalls of Predictive Policing: An Ethical Analysis\n\nPredictive policing relies on a large database of previous crime data and forecasts where crime is likely to occur. Since the program relies on old data, those previous arrests need to be unbiased to generate unbiased forecasts.\nPeople of color are arrested far more often than white people for committing the same crime.\nRacially biased arrest data creates biased forecasts in neighborhoods where more people of color are arrested.\nIf the predictive policing algorithm is using biased data to divert more police forces towards less affluent neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color, then those neighborhoods are not receiving the same treatment as others.\n\nBias in Criminal Risk Scores Is Mathematically Inevitable, Researchers Say\n\nThe algorithm COMPAS which predicts whether a person is “high-risk” and deemed more likely to be arrested in the future, leads to being imprisoned (instead of sent to rehab) or longer sentences.\n\nCan bots discriminate? It’s a big question as companies use AI for hiring\n\nIf an older candidate makes it past the resume screening process but gets confused by or interacts poorly with the chatbot, that data could teach the algorithm that candidates with similar profiles should be ranked lower\n\nEcho chambers, rabbit holes, and ideological bias: How YouTube recommends content to real users\n\nWe find that YouTube’s algorithm pushes real users into (very) mild ideological echo chambers.\nWe found that 14 out of 527 (~3%) of our users ended up in rabbit holes.\nFinally, we found that, regardless of the ideology of the study participant, the algorithm pushes all users in a moderately conservative direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to do things a bit differently than how I approached Lesson 1. Jeremy suggested that we first watch the video without pausing in order to understand what we’re going to do and then watch it a second time and follow along. I also want to be mindful of how long I’m running my Paperspace Gradient maching (at $0.51/hour) so that I don’t run the machine when I don’t need its GPU.\nSo, here’s how I’m going to approach Lesson 2: - Read the Chapter 2 Questionnaire so I know what I’ll be “tested” on at the end - Watch the video without taking notes or running code - Rewatch the video and take notes in this notebook - Add the Kaggle code cells to this notebook and run them in Paperspace - Read the Gradio tutorial without running code - Re-read the Gradio tutorial and follow along with my own code - Read Chapter 2 in the textbook and run code in this notebook in Paperspace - Read Chapter 2 in the textbook and take notes in this notebook (including answers to the Questionnaire)\nWith this approach, I’ll have a big picture understanding of each step of the lesson and I’ll minimize the time I’m spending running my Paperspace Gradient machine.\n\n\nLink to this lesson’s video.\n\nIn this lesson we’re doing things that hasn’t been in courses like this before.\nResource: aiquizzes.com—I signed up and answered a couple of questions.\nDon’t forget the FastAI Forums\n\nClick “Summarize this Topic” to get a list of the most upvoted posts\n\nHow do we go about putting a model in production?\n\nFigure out what problem you want to solve\nFigure out how to get data for it\nGather some data\n\nUse DuckDuckGo image function\nDownload data\nGet rid of images that failed to open\n\nData cleaning\n\nBefore you clean your data, train the model\nImageClassifierCleaner can be used to clean (delete or re-label) the wrongly labeled data in the dataset\n\ncleaner orders by loss so you only need to look at the first few\n\nAlways build a model to find out what things are difficult to recognize in your data and to find the things the model can help you find that are problems in the data\n\nTrain your model again\nDeploy to HuggingFace Spaces\n\nInstall Jupyter Notebook Extensions to get features like table of contents and collapsible sections (with which you can also navigate sections using arrow keys)\nType ?? followed by function name to get source code\nType ? followed by function name to get brief info\nIf you have nbdev installed doc(&lt;fn&gt;) will give you link to documentation\nDifferent ways to resize an image\n\nResizeMethod.Squish (to see the whole picture with different aspect ratio)\nResizeMethod.Pad (whole image in correct aspect ratio)\n\nData Augmentation\n\nRandomResizedCrop (different bit of an image everytime)\nbatch_tfms=aug_tranforms() (images get turned, squished, warped, saturated, recolored, etc.)\n\nUse if you are training for more than 5-10 epochs\nIn memory, real-time, the image is being resized/cropped/etc.\n\n\nConfusion matrix (ClassificationInterpretation)\n\nOnly meaningful for category labels\nShows what category errors your model is making (actual vs predicted)\nIn a lot of situations this will let you know what the hard categories to classify are (e.g. breeds of pets hard to identify)\n.plot_top_losses tells us where the loss is the highest (prediction/actual/loss/probability)\n\nA loss will be bad (high) if we are wrong + confident or right + unconfident\n\n\nOn your computer, normal RAM doesn’t get filled up as it saves RAM to hard disk (swapping).

constraints and overestimating the capabilities of deep learning may lead to frustratingly poor results, at least until you gain some experience and can solve the problems that arise.\nOverstimating the constraints and underestimating the capabilities of deep learning may mean you do not attempt a solvable problem because you talk yourself out of it.\nThe most important thing (as you learn deep learning) is to ensure that you have a project to work on.\nThe goal is not to find the “perfect” dataset or project, but just to get started and iterate from there.\nComplete every step as well as you can in a reasonable amount of time, all the way to the end.\nComputer vision\n\nObject recognition: recognize items in an image\nObject detection: recognition + highlight the location and name of each found object.\nDeep learning algorithms are generally not good at recognizing images that are significantly different in structure or style from those used to train the model.\n\nNLP\n\nDeep learning is not good at generating correct responses.\nText generation models will always be technologically a bit ahead of models for recognizing automatically generated text.\nGoogle’s online translation system is based on deep learning.\n\nCombining text and images\n\nA deep learning model can be trained on input images with output captions written in English, and can learn to generate surprisingly appropriate captions automatically for new images (with no guarantee the captions will be correct).\nDeep learning should be used not as an entirely automated process, but as part of a process in which the model and a human user interact closely.\n\nTabular data\n\nIf you already have a system that is using random forests or gradient boosting machines then switching to or adding deep learning may not result in any dramatic improvement.\nDeep learning greatly increases the variety of columns that you can include.\nDeep learning models generally take longer to train than random forests or gradient boosting machines.\n\nRecommendation systems\n\nA special type of tabular data (a high-cardinality categorical variable representing users and another one representing products or something similar).\nDeep learning models are good at handling high cardinality categorical variables and thus recommendation systems.\nDeep learning models do well when combining these variables with other kinds of data such as natural language, images, or additional metadata represented as tables such as user information, previous transactions, and so forth.\nNearly all machine learning approaches have th downside that they tell you only which products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations would be helpful for a user.\n\nOther data types\n\nUsing NLP deep learning methods is the current SOTA approach for many types of protein analysis since protein chains look a lot like natural language documents.\n\nThe Drivetrain Approach\n\nDefined objective\nLevers (what inputs can we control)\nData (what inputs we can collect)\nModels (how the levers influence the objective)\n\nGathering data\n\nFor most projects you can find the data online.\nUse duckduckgo_search\n\nFrom Data to DataLoaders\n\nDataLoaders is a thin class that just stores whatever DataLoader objects you pass to it and makes them available as train and valid.\nTo turn data into a DataLoaders object we need to tell fastai four things:\n\nWhat kinds of data we are working with.\nHow to get the list of items.\nHow to label these items.\nHow to create the validation set.\n\nWith the DataBlock API you can customize every stage of the creation of your DataLoaders:\n\n\nbears = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=Resize(128))\n\nexplanation of DataBlock\n\nblocks specifies types for independent (the thing we are using to make predictions from) and dependent (our target) variables.\nComputers don’t really know how to create random numbers at all, but simply create lists of numbers that look random; if you provide the same starting point for that list each time–called the seed–then you will get the exact same list each time.\nImages need to be all the same size.\nA DataLoader is a class that provides batches of a few items at a time to the GPU.\nfastai default batch size is 64 items.\nResize crops the images to fit a square shape, alternatively you can pad (ResizeMethod.Pad) or squish (ResizeMethod.Squish) the images to fit the square.\nSquishing (model learns that things look differently from how they actually are), cropping (removal of features that would allow us to perform recognition) and padding (lot of empty space which is just wasted computation) are wasteful or problematic approaches. Instead, randomly select part of the image and then crop to just that part. On each epoch, we randomly select a different part of each image (RandomResizedCrop(min_scale)).\nTraining the neural network with examples of images in which objects are in slightly different places and are slightly different sizes helps it to understand the basic concept of what an object is and how it can be represented in an image.\n\nData Augmentation\n\nrefers to creating random variations of our input data, such that they appear different but do not change the meaning of the data (rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes, and contrast changes).\naug_transforms() provides a standard set of augmentations.\nUse batch_tfms to process a batch at a time on the GPU to save time.\n\nTraining your model and using it to clean your data\n\nView confusion matrix with ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn). The diagonal shows images that are classified correctly. Calculated using validation set.\nSort images by loss using interp.plot_top_losses().\nLoss is high if the model is incorrect (especially if it’s also confident) or if it’s correct but not confident.\nA model can help you find data issues more quickly.\n\nUsing the model for inference\n\nlearn.export() will export a .pkl file.\nGet predictions with learn_inf.predict(&lt;input&gt;). This returns three things: the predicted category in the same format you originally provided, the index of the predicted category and the probabilities for each category.\nYou can access the DataLoaders as an attribute of the Learner: learn_inf.dls.\n\nDeploying your app\n\nYou almost certainly do not need a GPU to serve your model in production.\nTo classify a few users’ images at a time, you need high-volume. If you do have this scenario, use Microsoft’s ONNX Runtime or AWS SageMaker.\nRecommended wherever possible to deploy the model itself to a server and have your mobile/edge application connect to it as a web service.\nIf your application uses sensitive data, your users may be concerned about an approach that sends that data to a remote server.\n\nHow to Avoid Disaster\n\nUnderstanding and testing the behavior of a deep learning model is much more difficult than with most other code you write.\nThe kinds of photos that people are most likely to upload to the internet are the kinds of photos that do a good job of clearly and artistically displaying their subject matter, which isn’t the kind of input this system is going to be getting in real life. We may need to do a lot of our own data collection and labeling to create a useful system.\nout-of-domain data: data that our model sees in production that is very different from what it saw during training.\ndomain shift: data that our model sees changes over time.\nDeployment process\n\nManual Process: run model in parallel, humans check all predictions.\nLimited scope deployment: careful human supervision, time or geography limited.\nGradual expansion: good reporting systems needed, consider what could go wrong.\n\nUnforeseen consequences and feedback loops\n\nYour model may change the behavior of the system it’s a part of.\nfeedback loops can result in negative implications of bias getting worse.\nA helpful exercise prior to rolling out a significant machine learning system is to consider the question “What would happen if it went really, really well?”\n\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nWhere do text models currently have a major deficiency?\n\nProviding correct or accurate information.\n\nWhat are possible negative societal implications of text generation models?\n\nThe viral spread of misinformation, which can lead to real actions and harms.\n\nIn situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a god alternative to automating a process?\n\nRun the model in parallel with a human checking its predictions.\n\nWhat kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at?\n\nHigh-cardinality categorical data.\n\nWhat’s a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems?\n\nIt will only tell you which products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations may be helpful for a user.\n\nWhat are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach?\n\nDefine an objective\nDetermine what inputs (levers) you can control\nCollect data\nCreate models (how the levers influence the objective)\n\nHow do the steps of the Drivetrain Approach map to a recommendation system?\n\nObjective: drive additional sales due to recommendations.\nLevel: ranking of the recommendations.\nData: must be collectd to generate recommendations that will cause new sales.\nModels: two for purchasing probabilities conditional on seeing or not seeing a recommendation, the difference between these two probabilities is a utility function for a given recommendation to a customer (low in cases when algorithm recommends a familiar book that the customer has already rejected, or a book they would have bought even without the recommendation).\n\nCreate an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy it on the web.\n\nHere.\n\nWhat is DataLoaders?\n\nA class that creates validation and training sets/batches that are fed to the GPUS\n\nWhat four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders?\n\nWhat kinds of data we are working with (independent and dependent variables).\nHow to get the list of items.\nHow to label these items.\nHow to create the validation set.\n\nWhat does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do?\n\nSet aside a percentage of the data as the validation set.\n\nHow do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set?\n\nSet the seed parameter to the same value.\n\nWhat letters are often used to signify the independent and dependent variables?\n\nIndependent: x\nDependent: y\n\nWhat’s the difference between crop, pad and squish resize approaches? When might you choose one over the others?\n\nCrop: takes a section of the image and resizes it to the desired size. Use when it’s not necessary to have the model traing on the whole image.\nPad: keep the image aspect ratio as is, add white/black padding to make a square. Use when it’s necessary to have the model train on the whole image.\nSquish: distorts the image to fit a square. Use when it’s not necessary to have the model train on the original aspect ratio.\n\nWhat is data augmentation? Why is it needed?\n\nData augmentation is the creation of random variations of input data through techniques like rotation, flipping, brightness changes, contrast changes, perspective warping. It is needed to help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting/perspective conditions.\n\nProvide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data.\nWhat is the difference between item_tfms and batch_tfms?\n\nitem_tfms are transforms that are applied to each item in the set.\nbatch_tfms are transforms applied to a batch of items in the set.\n\nWhat is a confusion matrix?\n\nA matrix that shows the counts of predicted (columns) vs. actual (rows) labels, with the diagonal being correctly predicted data.\n\nWhat does export save?\n\nBoth the architecture and the parameters as a .pkl file.\n\nWhat is called when we use a model for making predictions, instead of training?\n\nInference\n\nWhat are IPython widgets?\n\ninteractive browser controls for Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nWhen would you use a CPU for deployment? When might a GPU be better?\n\nCPU: low-volume, single-user inputs for prediction.\nGPU: high-volume, multiple-user inputs for predictions.\n\nWhat are the downsides of deploying your app to a server, instead of to a client (or edge) device such as a phone or PC?\n\nRequires internet connectivity (and latency).\nSensitive data transfer may not be okay with your users.\nManaging complexity and scaling the server creates additional overhead.\n\nWhat are three examples of problems that could occur when rolling out a bear warning system in practice?\n\nout-of-domain data: the images captured of real bears may not be represented in the model’s training or validation datasets.\nNumber of bear alerts doubles or halves after rollout of the new system in some location.\nout-of-domain data: the cameras may capture low-resolution images of the bears when the training and validation set had high resolution images.\n\nWhat is out-of-domain data?\n\nData your model sees in production that it hasn’t seen during training.\n\nWhat is domain shift?\n\nChanges in the data that our model sees in production over time.\n\nWhat are the three steps in the deployment process?\n\nManual Process\nLimited scope deployment\nGradual expansion\n\n\nFurther Research\n\nConsider how the Drivetrain Approach maps to a project or problem you’re interested in.\n\nI’ll take the example of a project I will be working on to practice what I’m learning in this book: training a deep learning model which correctly classifies the typeface from a collection of single letter.\n\nThe objective: correctly classify typeface from a collection of single letters.\nLevers: observe key features of key letters that are the “tell” of a typeface.\nData: using an HTML canvas object and Adobe Fonts, generate images of single letters of multiple fonts associated with each category of typeface.\nModels: output the probabilities of each typeface a given collection of single letters is predicted as. This allows for some flexibility in how you categorize letters based on the shared characteristics of more than one typeface that the particular font may possess.\n\n\nWhen might it be best to avoid certain types of data augmentation?\n\nIn my typeface example, it’s best to avoid perspective warping because it will change key features used to recognize a typeface.\n\nFor a project you’re interested in applying deep learning to, consider the thought experiment, “What would happen if it went really, really well?”\n\nIf my typeface classifier works really well, I imagine it would be used by people to take pictures of real-world text and learn what typeface it is. This may inspire a new wave of typeface designers. If a feedback loop was possible, and the classifier went viral, the very definition of typefaces may be affected by popular opinion. Taken a step further, a generative model may be inspired by this classifier, and a new wave of AI typeface would be launched—however this last piece is highly undesirable unless the training of the model involves appropriate licensing and attribution of the typefaces used that are created by humans. Furthermore, from what I understand from reading about typefaces, the process of creating a typeface is an amazing experience and should not be replaced with AI generators. If I created such a generative model (in part 2 of the course) and it went viral (do HuggingFace Spaces go viral? Cuz that’s where I would launch it), I would take it down.\n\nStart a blog (done!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to this lesson’s video.\n\nHow to do a fast.ai lesson\n\nWatch lecture\nRun notebook & experiment\nReproduce results\nRepeat with different dataset\n\nfastbook repo contains “clean” folder with notebooks without markdown text.\nTwo concepts: training the model and using it for inference.\nOver 500 architectures in timm (PyTorch Image Models).\ntimm.list_models(pattern) will list models matching the pattern.\nPass string name of timm model to the Learner like: vision_learner(dls, 'timm model string', ...).\nin22 = ImageNet with 22k categories, 1k = ImageNet with 1k categories.\nlearn.predict probabilities are in the order of learn.dls.vocab.\nlearn.model contains the trained model which contains lots of nested layers.\nlearn.model.get_submodule takes a dotted string navigating through the hierarchy.\nMachine learning models fit functions to data.\nThings between dollar signs is LaTeX \"$...$\".\nGeneral form of quadratic: def quad(a,b,c,x): return a*x**2 + b*x + c\npartial from functools fixes parameters to a function.\nLoss functions tells us how good our model is.\n@interact from ipywidgets allows sliders tied to the function its above.\nMean Squared Error: def mse(preds, acts): return ((preds - acts)**2).mean()\nFor each parameter we need to know: does the loss get better when we increase or decrease the parameter?\nThe derivative is the function that tells you: if you increase the input does the output increase or decrease, and by how much?\n*params spreads out the list into its elements and passes each to the function.\n1-D (rank 1) tensor (lists of numbers), 2-D tensor (tables of numbers) 3-D tensor (layers of tables of numbers) and so on.\ntensor.requires_grad_() calculates the gradient of the values in the tensor whenever its used in calculation.\nloss.backward() calculates gradients on the inputs to the loss function.\nabc.grad attribute added after gradients are calculated.\nnegative gradient means increasing the parameter will decrease the loss.\nupdate parameters with torch.no_grad() so PyTorch doesn’t calculate the gradient (since it’s being used in a function).

We need to automate this process.\nIf we know the gradient of our mae() function with respect to our parameters, a, b and c, then that means we know how adjusting a parameter will change the function. If, say, a has a negative gradient, then we know increasing a will decrease mae(). So we find the gradient of the parameters with respect to the loss function and adjust our parameters a bit in the opposite direction of the gradient sign.\nTo do this we need a function that will take the parameters as a single vector:\n\ndef quad_mae(params):\n    f = mk_quad(*params)\n    return mae(f(x), y)\n\n\n# testing it out\n# should equal 2.4219\nquad_mae([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n\n\n# pick an arbitrary starting point for our parameters\nabc = torch.tensor([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\n# tell pytorch to calculate its gradients\nabc.requires_grad_()\n\n# calculate loss\nloss = quad_mae(abc)\nloss\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\n# calculate gradients\nloss.backward()\n\n# view gradients\nabc.grad\n\ntensor([-1.3529, -0.0316, -0.5000])\n\n\n\n# increase parameters to decrease loss based on gradient sign\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n\nprint(f'loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nloss=2.40\n\n\nThe loss has gone down from 2.4219 to 2.40. We’re moving in the right direction.\nThe small number we multiply gradients by is called the learning rate and is the most important hyper-parameter to set when training a neural network.\n\n# use a loop to do a few more iterations\nfor i in range(10):\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    loss.backward()\n    with torch.no_grad(): abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    print(f'step={i}; loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nstep=0; loss=2.40\nstep=1; loss=2.36\nstep=2; loss=2.30\nstep=3; loss=2.21\nstep=4; loss=2.11\nstep=5; loss=1.98\nstep=6; loss=1.85\nstep=7; loss=1.72\nstep=8; loss=1.58\nstep=9; loss=1.46\n\n\nThe loss continues to decrease.

Drawing squiggly lines through some points is literally all that deep learning does. The above steps will, given enough time and enough data, create (for example) an owl recognizer if you feed it enough owls and non-owls.\nWe can could do thousands of computations on a GPU instead of the above CPU computation. We can greatly reduce the amount of computation and data needed by using a convolution instead of a matrix multiplication. We could make things much faster if, instead of starting with random parameters, we start with parameters of someone else’s model that does something similar to what we want (transfer learning).\n\n\n\nFollowing the instructions in the fastai course lesson video, I’ve created a Microsoft Excel deep learning model here for the Titanic Kaggle data.\nAs shown in the course video, I trained three different models—linear regression, neural net (using SUMPRODUCT) and neural net (using MMULT). After running Microsoft Excel’s Solver, I got the final (different than video) mean loss for each model:\n\nlinear: 0.14422715\nnnet: 0.14385956\nmmult: 0.14385956\n\nThe linear model loss in the video was about 0.10 and the neural net loss was about 0.08. So, my models didn’t do as well.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes while reading Chapter 4 in the fastai textbook.\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the MNIST dataset for our experiments, which contains handwritten digits.\nMNIST is collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and collated into a machine learning dataset by Yann Lecun who used MNIST in 1998 in LeNet-5, the first computer system to demonstrate practically useful recognition of handwritten digits.\nWe’ve seen that the only consisten trait among every fast.ai student who’s gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious.\nIn this chapter we’ll create a model that can classify any image as a 3 or a 7.\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n\npath = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.14% [3219456/3214948 00:00&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n# ls method added by fastai\n# lists the count of items\npath.ls()\n\n(#3) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/labels.csv'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid')]\n\n\n\n(path/'train').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/7')]\n\n\n\n# 3 and 7 are the labels\nthrees = (path/'train'/'3').ls().sorted()\nsevens = (path/'train'/'7').ls().sorted()\nthrees\n\n(#6131) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10000.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10011.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10031.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10034.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10042.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10052.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/1007.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10074.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10091.png')...]\n\n\n\n# view one of the images\nim3_path = threes[1]\nim3 = Image.open(im3_path)\nim3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the image is stored as numbers\narray(im3)[4:10, 4:10]\n\narray([[  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],\n       [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  29],\n       [  0,   0,   0,  48, 166, 224],\n       [  0,  93, 244, 249, 253, 187],\n       [  0, 107, 253, 253, 230,  48],\n       [  0,   3,  20,  20,  15,   0]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\n\n# same thing, but a PyTorch tensor\ntensor(im3)[4:10, 4:10]\n\ntensor([[  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],\n        [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  29],\n        [  0,   0,   0,  48, 166, 224],\n        [  0,  93, 244, 249, 253, 187],\n        [  0, 107, 253, 253, 230,  48],\n        [  0,   3,  20,  20,  15,   0]], dtype=torch.uint8)\n\n\n\n# use pandas.DataFrame to color code the array\nim3_t = tensor(im3)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(im3_t[4:15, 4:22])\ndf.style.set_properties(**{'font-size': '6pt'}).background_gradient('Greys')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n29\n150\n195\n254\n255\n254\n176\n193\n150\n96\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n48\n166\n224\n253\n253\n234\n196\n253\n253\n253\n253\n233\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n0\n93\n244\n249\n253\n187\n46\n10\n8\n4\n10\n194\n253\n253\n233\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n107\n253\n253\n230\n48\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n192\n253\n253\n156\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n5\n0\n3\n20\n20\n15\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n43\n224\n253\n245\n74\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n249\n253\n245\n126\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n14\n101\n223\n253\n248\n124\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n11\n166\n239\n253\n253\n253\n187\n30\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n16\n248\n250\n253\n253\n253\n253\n232\n213\n111\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n10\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n43\n98\n98\n208\n253\n253\n253\n253\n187\n22\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe background white pixels are stored a the number 0, black is the number 255, and shades of grey between the two. The entire image contains 28 pixels across and 28 pixels down for a total of 768 pixels.\nHow might a computer recognize these two digits?\nIdeas:\n3s and 7s have distinct features. A seven has generally two straight lines at different angles, a three as two sets of curves stacked on each other. The point where the two curves intersect could be a recognizable feature of the the digit three. The point where the two straight-ish lines intersect could be a recognizable feature of the digit seven. One feature of confusion could be handwritten threes with a straight line at the top, similar to a seven. Another feature of confusion could be a handwritten 3 with a straight-ish ending stroke at the bottom, matching a similar stroke of a 7.\n\n\n\nIdea: find the average pixel value for every pixel of the 3s, then do the same for the 7s. To classify an image, see which of the two ideal digits the image is most similar to.\n\nBaseline: A simple model that you are confident should perform reasonably well. It should be simple to implement and easy to test, so that you can then test each of your improved ideas and make sure they are always better than your baseline. Without starting with a sensible baseline, it is difficult to know whether your super-fancy models are any good.\n\n\n# list comprehension of all digit images\nseven_tensors = [tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in sevens]\nthree_tensors = [tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in threes]\nlen(three_tensors), len(seven_tensors)\n\n(6131, 6265)\n\n\n\n# use fastai's show_image to display tensor images\nshow_image(three_tensors[1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor every pixel position, we want to compute the average over all the images of the intensity of that pixel.

We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would “learn” from its experience.\n\nOur pixel similarity approach doesn’t have any weight assignment, or any way of improving based on testing the effectiveness of a weight assignment. We can’t improve our pixel similarity approach.\nWe could look at each individual pixel and come up with a set of weights for each, such that the highest weights are associated with those pixels most likely to be black for a particular category. For example, pixels toward the bottom right are not very likely to be activate for a 7, so they should have a low weight for a 7, but ther are likely to be activated for an 8, so they should have a high weight for an 8. This can be represented as a function and set of weight values for each possible category, for instance, the probability of being the number 8:\ndef pr_eight(x,w) = (x*w).sum()\nX is the image, represented as a vector (with all the rows stacked up end to end into a single long line) and the weights are a vector W. We need some way to update the weights to make them a little bit better. We want to find the specific values for the vector W that cause the result of our function to be high for those images that are 8s and low for those images that are not. Searching for the best vector W is a way to search for the best function for recognizing 8s.\nSteps required to turn this function into a machine learning classifier:\n\nInitialize the weights.\nFor each image, use these weights to predict whether it appears to be a 3 or a 7.\nBased on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its loss).\nCalculate the gradient, which measures for each weight how changing that weight would change the loss.\nStep (that is, change) all the weights based on that calculation.\nGo back to step 2 and repeat the process.\nIterate until you decide to stop the training process (for instance, because the model is good enough or you don’t want to wait any longer).\n\nInitialize: Initialize parameters to random values.\nLoss: We need a function that will return a number that is small if the performance of the model is good (by convention).\nStep: Gradients allow us to directly figure out in which direction and by roughly how much to change each weight.\nStop: Keep training until the accuracy of the model started getting worse or we ran out of time, or once the number of epochs we decided are complete.\n\n\n\nCreate an example loss function:\n\ndef f(x): return x**2\n\nPick a tensor value at which we want gradients:\n\nxt = tensor(3.).requires_grad_()\n\n\nyt = f(xt)\nyt\n\ntensor(9., grad_fn=&lt;PowBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nCalculate gradients (backpropagation–during the backward pass of the network, as opposed to forward pass which is where the activations are calculated):\n\nyt.backward()\n\nView the gradients:\n\nxt.grad\n\ntensor(6.)\n\n\nThe derivative of x**2 is 2*x. When x = 3 the derivative is 6, as calculated above.\nCalculating vector gradients:\n\nxt = tensor([3., 4., 10.]).requires_grad_()\nxt\n\ntensor([ 3.,  4., 10.], requires_grad=True)\n\n\nAdd sum to our function so it takes a vector and returns a scalar:\n\ndef f(x): return (x**2).sum()\n\n\nyt = f(xt)\nyt\n\ntensor(125., grad_fn=&lt;SumBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nyt.backward()\nxt.grad\n\ntensor([ 6.,  8., 20.])\n\n\nIf the gradients are very large, that may suggest that we have more adjustments to do, whereas if they are very small, that may suggest that we are close to the optimal value.\n\n\n\nDeciding how to change our parameters based on the values of the gradients—multiplying the gradient by some small number called the learning rate (LR):\nw -= w.grad * lr\nThis is knowns as stepping your parameters using an optimization step.\nIf you pick a learning rate too low, that can mean having to do a lot of steps. If you pick a learning rate too high, that’s even worse, because it can result in the loss getting worse. If the learning rate is too high it may also “bounce” around.\n\n\n\nExample: measuring the speed of a roller coaster as it went over the top of a hump.

It’s not useful to use accuracy as a loss function.\nWe need a loss function that when our weights result in slightly better predictions, gives us a slightly better loss.\nIn this case, what does “slightly better prediction mean”: if the correct answer is 3 (1), the score is a little higher, or if the correct answer is a 7 (0), the score is a little lower.\nThe loss function receives not the images themselves, but the predictions from the model.\nThe loss function will measure how distant each prediction is from 1 (if it should be 1) and how distant it is from 0 (if it should be 0) and then it will take the mean of all those distances.\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\nTry it out with sample predictions and targets:\n\ntrgts = tensor([1,0,1])\nprds = tensor([0.9, 0.4, 0.2])\ntorch.where(trgts==1, 1-prds, prds)\n\ntensor([0.1000, 0.4000, 0.8000])\n\n\nThis function returns a lower number when predictions are more accurate, when accurate predictions are more confident and when inaccurate predictions are less confident.\nSince we need a scalar for the final loss, mnist_loss takes the mean of the previous tensor:\n\nmnist_loss(prds, trgts)\n\ntensor(0.4333)\n\n\nmnist_loss assumes that predictions are between 0 and 1. We need to ensure that, using sigmoid, which always outputs a number between 0 and 1:\n\ndef sigmoid(x): return 1/(1+torch.exp(-x))\n\n\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, title='Sigmoid', min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s also a smooth curve that only goes up, which makes it easier for SGD to find meaningful gradients. Update mnist+loss to first apply sigmoid to the inputs:\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  predictions = predictions.sigmoid()\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\nWe already had a metric, which was overall accuracy. So why did we define a loss?\nTo drive automated learning, the loss must be a function that has a meaningful derivative. It can’t have big flat sections and large jumps, but instead must be reasonably smooth. This is why we designed a loss function that would respond to small changes in confidence level.\nThe loss function is calculated for each item in our dataset, and then at the end of an epoch, the loss values are all averaged and the overall mean is reported for the epoch.\nIt is important that we focus on metrics, rather than the loss, when judging the performance of a model.\n\n\nThe optimization step: change or update the weights based on the gradients.\nTo take an optimization step, we need to calculate the loss over one or more data items. Calculating the loss for the whole dataset would take a long time, calculating it for a single item would not use much information so it would result in an imprecise and unstable gradient.\nCalculate the average loss for a few data items at a time (mini-batch). The number of data items in the mini-batch is called the batch-size.\nA larger batch size means you will get a more accurate and stable estimate of your dataset’s gradients from the loss function, but it will take longer and you will process fewer mini-batches per epoch. Using batches of data works well for GPUs, but give the GPU too many items at once and it will run out of memory.\nWe get better generalization if we can vary things during training (like performing data augmentation). One simple and effective thing we can vary is what data items we put in each mini-batch. Randomly shuffly the dataset before we create mini-batches. The DataLoader will do the shuffling and mini-batch collation for you:\n\ncoll = range(15)\ndl = DataLoader(coll, batch_size=5, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[tensor([10,  3,  8, 11,  0]),\n tensor([6, 1, 7, 9, 4]),\n tensor([12, 13,  5,  2, 14])]\n\n\nFor training, we want a collection containing independent and dependent variables. A Dataset in PyTorch is a collection containing tuples of independent and dependent variables.\n\nds = L(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase))\nds\n\n(#26) [(0, 'a'),(1, 'b'),(2, 'c'),(3, 'd'),(4, 'e'),(5, 'f'),(6, 'g'),(7, 'h'),(8, 'i'),(9, 'j')...]\n\n\n\nlist(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase))[:5]\n\n[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd'), (4, 'e')]\n\n\nWhen we pass a Dataset to a Dataloader we will get back many batches that are themselves tuples of tensors representing batches of independent and dependent variables:\n\ndl = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=6, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[(tensor([24,  2,  4,  8,  9, 13]), ('y', 'c', 'e', 'i', 'j', 'n')),\n (tensor([23, 17,  6, 14, 25, 18]), ('x', 'r', 'g', 'o', 'z', 's')),\n (tensor([22,  5,  7, 20,  3, 19]), ('w', 'f', 'h', 'u', 'd', 't')),\n (tensor([ 0, 21, 12,  1, 16, 10]), ('a', 'v', 'm', 'b', 'q', 'k')),\n (tensor([11, 15]), ('l', 'p'))]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn code, the process will be implemented something like this for each epoch:\nfor x,y in dl:\n  # calculate predictions\n  pred = model(x)\n  # calculate the loss\n  loss = loss_func(pred, y)\n  # calculate the gradients\n  loss.backward()\n  # step the weights\n  parameters -= parameters.grad * lr\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n\nweights = init_params((28*28, 1))\nbias = init_params(1)\n\nA DataLoader can be created from a Dataset:\n\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nxb,yb = first(dl)\nxb.shape, yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([256, 784]), torch.Size([256, 1]))\n\n\nDo the same for the validation set:\n\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256)\n\nCreate a mini-batch of size 4 for testing:\n\nbatch = train_x[:4]\nbatch.shape\n\ntorch.Size([4, 784])\n\n\n\npreds = linear1(batch)\npreds\n\ntensor([[10.4546],\n        [ 9.4603],\n        [-0.2426],\n        [ 6.7868]], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nloss = mnist_loss(preds, train_y[:4])\nloss\n\ntensor(0.1404, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate the gradients\n\nloss.backward()\nweights.grad.shape, weights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(torch.Size([784, 1]), tensor(-0.0089), tensor([-0.0619]))\n\n\nCreate a function to calculate gradients:\n\ndef calc_grad(xb, yb, model):\n  preds = model(xb)\n  loss = mnist_loss(preds, yb)\n  loss.backward()\n\nTest it:\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0178), tensor([-0.1238]))\n\n\nLook what happens when we call it again:\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0267), tensor([-0.1857]))\n\n\nThe gradients have changed. loss.backward adds the gradients of loss to any gradients that are currently stored. So we have to set the current gradients to 0 first:\n\nweights.grad.zero_()\nbias.grad.zero_();\n\nMethods in PyTorch whose names end in an underscore modify their objects in place.\nStep 5: Step the weights\nWhen we update the weights and biases based on the gradient and learning rate, we have to tell PyTorch not to take the gradient of this step. If we assign to the data attribute of a tensor, PyTorch will not take the gradient of that step. Here’s our basic training loop for an epoch:\n\ndef train_epoch(model, lr, params):\n  for xb,yb in dl:\n    calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n    for p in params:\n      p.data -= p.grad*lr\n      p.grad.zero_()\n\nWe want to check how we’re doing by looking at the accuracy of the validation set.

Modules are classes so you have to instantiate them.\n\nlearn = Learner(dls, simple_net, opt_func=SGD,\n                loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\n\n\nlearn.fit(40, 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nbatch_accuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.363529\n0.409795\n0.505888\n00:00\n\n\n1\n0.165949\n0.239534\n0.792934\n00:00\n\n\n2\n0.089140\n0.117148\n0.913150\n00:00\n\n\n3\n0.056798\n0.078107\n0.941119\n00:00\n\n\n4\n0.042071\n0.060734\n0.957311\n00:00\n\n\n5\n0.034718\n0.051121\n0.962218\n00:00\n\n\n6\n0.030605\n0.045103\n0.964181\n00:00\n\n\n7\n0.027994\n0.040995\n0.966143\n00:00\n\n\n8\n0.026145\n0.037990\n0.969087\n00:00\n\n\n9\n0.024728\n0.035686\n0.970559\n00:00\n\n\n10\n0.023585\n0.033853\n0.972522\n00:00\n\n\n11\n0.022634\n0.032346\n0.973994\n00:00\n\n\n12\n0.021826\n0.031080\n0.975466\n00:00\n\n\n13\n0.021127\n0.029996\n0.976448\n00:00\n\n\n14\n0.020514\n0.029053\n0.975957\n00:00\n\n\n15\n0.019972\n0.028221\n0.976448\n00:00\n\n\n16\n0.019488\n0.027481\n0.977920\n00:00\n\n\n17\n0.019051\n0.026818\n0.978410\n00:00\n\n\n18\n0.018654\n0.026219\n0.978410\n00:00\n\n\n19\n0.018291\n0.025677\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n20\n0.017958\n0.025181\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n21\n0.017650\n0.024727\n0.980373\n00:00\n\n\n22\n0.017363\n0.024310\n0.980864\n00:00\n\n\n23\n0.017096\n0.023925\n0.980864\n00:00\n\n\n24\n0.016846\n0.023570\n0.981845\n00:00\n\n\n25\n0.016610\n0.023241\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n26\n0.016389\n0.022935\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n27\n0.016179\n0.022652\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n28\n0.015980\n0.022388\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n29\n0.015791\n0.022142\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n30\n0.015611\n0.021913\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n31\n0.015440\n0.021700\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n32\n0.015276\n0.021500\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n33\n0.015120\n0.021313\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n34\n0.014969\n0.021137\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n35\n0.014825\n0.020972\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n36\n0.014686\n0.020817\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n37\n0.014553\n0.020671\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n38\n0.014424\n0.020532\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n39\n0.014300\n0.020401\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the training process in learn.recorder:\n\nplt.plot(L(learn.recorder.values).itemgot(2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the final accuracy:\n\nlearn.recorder.values[-1][2]\n\n0.982826292514801\n\n\nAt this point we have:\n\nA function that can solve any problem to any level of accuracy (the neural network) given the correct set of parameters.\nA way to find the best set of parameters for any function (stochastic gradient descent).\n\n\n\nWe can add as many layers in our neural network as we want, as long as we add a nonlinearity between each pair of linear layers.\nThe deeper the model gets, the harder it is to optimize the parameters.\nWith a deeper model (one with more layers) we do not need to use as many parameters. We can use smaller matrices with more layers and get better results than we would get with larger matrices and few layers.\nIn the 1990s what held back the field for years was that so few researchers were experimenting with more than one nonlinearity.\nTraining an 18-layer model:\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path)\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=False,\n                    loss_func=F.cross_entropy, metrics=accuracy)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.1)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/fastai/vision/learner.py:288: UserWarning: `cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\n  warn(\"`cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\")\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future.

The number of dimensions of a tensor is its rank.\nA neural network contains a number of layers. Each layer is either linear or nonlinear. We generally alternate between these two kinds of layers in a neural network. Sometimes a nonlinearity is referred to as an activation function.\nKey concepts related to SGD:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nReLU\nFunction that returns 0 for negative numbers and doesn’t change positive numbers.\n\n\nMini-batch\nA small group of inputs and labels gathered together in two arrays.

How is a grayscale image represented on a computer? How about a color image?\nGrayscale image pixels can be 0 (black) to 255 (white). Color image pixels have three values (Red, Green, Blue) where each value can be from 0 to 255.\n2. How are the files and folders in the MNIST_SAMPLE dataset structured? Why?\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#3) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/labels.csv'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid')]\n\n\nMNIST_SAMPLE path has a labels.csv file, a train folder, and a valid folder.\n\n(path/'train').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/7')]\n\n\nThe train folder has a 3 and a 7 folder, each which contains training images.\n\n(path/'valid').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid/7')]\n\n\nThe valid folder contains a 3 and a 7 folder, each containing validation set images.\n3. Explain how the “pixel similarity” approach to classifying digits works.\nPixel similarity works by calculating the absolute mean difference (L1 norm) between each image and the mean digit 3, and averaging the classification (if the absolute mean difference between the image and the ideal 3 is less than the absolute mean difference between the image and the ideal 7, it’s classified as a 3) across all images of each digit’s validation set as the accuracy of the model.\n4. What is list comprehension? Create one now that selects odd numbers from a list and doubles them.\nList comprehension is syntax for creating a new list based on another sequence or iterable (docs)\n\n# for each element in range(10)\n# if the modulo of the element and 2 is not 0\n# double the element's value and store in this new list\ndoubled_odds = [2*elem for elem in range(10) if elem % 2 != 0]\ndoubled_odds\n\n[2, 6, 10, 14, 18]\n\n\n5. What is a rank-3 tensor?\nA rank-3 tensor is a “cube” (3-dimensional tensor).\n6. What is the difference between tensor rank and shape? How do you get the rank from the shape?\nTensor rank is the number of dimensions of the tensor. Tensor shape is the number of elements in each dimension. The following tensor is a 2-dimensional tensor with rank 2, the shape of which is 3 elements by 2 elements.\n\na_tensor = tensor([[1,3], [4,5], [5,6]])\n# dim == rank\na_tensor.dim(), a_tensor.shape\n\n(2, torch.Size([3, 2]))\n\n\n7. What are RMSE and L1 norm?\nRMSE = Root Mean Squared Error: The square root of the mean of squared differences between two sets of values.\nL1 norm = mean absolute difference: the mean of the absolute value of differences between two sets of values.\n8. How can you apply a calculation on thousands of numbers at once, many thousands of times faster than a Python loop?\nYou can do so by using tensors on a GPU.\n9. Create a 3x3 tensor or array containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Double it. Select the bottom four numbers.\n\na_tensor = tensor([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])\na_tensor\n\ntensor([[1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\n\na_tensor = 2 * a_tensor\na_tensor\n\ntensor([[ 2,  4,  6],\n        [ 8, 10, 12],\n        [14, 16, 18]])\n\n\n\na_tensor.view(-1, 9)[0,-4:]\n\ntensor([12, 14, 16, 18])\n\n\n10. What is broadcasting? Broadcasting is when a tensor of smaller rank (or a scalar) is expanded so that you can perform an operation between it and a tensor of larger rank. Broadcasting makes it so that the two operands have the same rank.\n\na_tensor + tensor([1,2,3])\n\ntensor([[ 3,  6,  9],\n        [ 9, 12, 15],\n        [15, 18, 21]])\n\n\n\nAre metrics generally calculated using the training set or the validation set? Why?\n\nMetrics are calculated on the validation set because since that is the data the model does not see during training, the metric tells you how your model performs on data it hasn’t seen before.\n12. What is SGD?\nSGD is Stochastic Gradient Descent, an automated process where a model learns the right parameters needed to solve problems like image classification. The randomly (from scratch) or pretrained (transfer learning) parameters are updated using their gradients with respect to the loss and the learning rate. Metrics like the accuracy measure how well the model is performing.\n13. Why does SGD use mini-batches?\nOne reason is to utilize the ability of a GPU to process a lot of data at once.\nAnother reason is that calculating the loss one image at a time leads to an unstable loss function whereas calculating the loss on the entire dataset takes too long. Mini-batches fall in between these two extremes.\n14. What are the seven steps in SGD for machine learning?\n\nInitialize the weights.\nCalculate the predictions.\nCalculate the loss.\nCalculate gradients.\nStep the weights.\nRepeat the process.\nStop.\n\n15. How do we initialize the weights in a model?\nEither randomly (if training from scratch) or using pretrained weights (if transfer learning from an existing model like resnet18).\n16. What is loss?\nA machine-friendly way to measure how well (or badly) the model is performing. The model is learning to step the weights in order to decrease the loss.\n17. Why can’t we always use a high learning rate?\nBecause we risk overshooting the minimum loss (getting stuck back and forth between the two sides of the parabola) or diverging (resulting in larger losses each step).\n18. What is a gradient?\nThe rate of change or derivative of one variable with respect to another variable. In our case, gradients are the ratio of change in loss to change in parameter at one point.\n19. Do you need to know how to calculate gradients yourself?\nNope! Although you should understand the basic concept of derivatives. PyTorch calculates gradients with the .backward method.\n20. Why can’t we use accuracy as a loss function?\nBecause small changes in predictions do not result in small changes in accuracy. Accuracy drastically jumps (from 0 to 1 in our MNIST_SAMPLE example) at one point, with 0 slope elsewhere. We want a smooth function where you can calculate non-zero and non-infinite derivatives everywhere.\n21. Draw the sigmoid function. What is special about its shape?\nThe sigmoid function outputs between 0 and 1 for input values going from -inf to +inf. It also has a smooth positive slope everywhere so it’s easy to take the derivate.\n\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, title='Sigmoid', min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22. What is the difference between a loss function and a metric?\nThe loss function is a machine-friendly way to measure the performance of the model while a metric is a human-friendly way to do the same.\nThe purpose of the loss function is to provide a smooth function to take derivates over so the training system can change the weights little by little towards the optimum.\nThe purpose of the metric is to inform the human how well or badly the model is learning during training.\n23. What is the function to calculate new weights using a learning rate?\nIn code, the function is:\nparameters.data -= parameters.grad * lr\nThe new weights are stepped incrementally in the opposite direction of the gradients. If the gradient is negative, the weights will be increased. If the gradient is positive, the weights will be decreased.\n24. What does the DataLoader class do?\nThe DataLoader class prepares training and validation batches and feeds them to the GPU during training. It also performs any necessary item_tfms or batch_tfms to the data.\n25. Write pseudocode showing the basic steps taken in each epoch for SGD.\ndef train_epoch(model):\n  # calculate predictions\n  preds = model(xb)\n  # calculate the loss\n  loss = loss_func(preds, targets)\n  # calculate gradients\n  loss.backward()\n  # step the weights\n  params.data -= params.grad * lr\n  # reset the gradients\n  params.zero_grad_()\n  # calculate accuracy\n  acc = tensor([accuracy for each batch]).mean()\n\nCreate a function that, if passed two arguments [1, 2, 3, 4] and 'abcd', returns [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]. What is special about that output data structure?\n\n\ndef zipped_tuples(x, y): return list(zip(x,y))\n\n\nzipped_tuples([1,2,3,4], 'abcd')\n\n[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]\n\n\nThe output data structure is the same structure as the PyTorch Dataset.\n27. What does view do in PyTorch?\nview changes the rank and shape of the tensor.\n\ntensor([1,2,3],[4,5,6]).view(3,2)\n\ntensor([[1, 2],\n        [3, 4],\n        [5, 6]])\n\n\n\ntensor([1,2,3],[4,5,6]).view(6)\n\ntensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\n\n28. What are the bias parameters in a neural network? Why do we need them?\nThe bias parameters are the intercept \\(b\\) in the function \\(y = wx + b\\). We need them for situations where the inputs are 0 (since \\(w*0 = 0\\)). Bias also helps to create a more flexible function (source).\n29. What does the @ operator do in Python?\nMatrix multiplication.\n\nv1 = tensor([1,2,3])\nv2 = tensor([4,5,6])\nv1 @ v2\n\ntensor(32)\n\n\n30. What does the backward method do?\nCalculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters.\n31. Why do we have to zero the gradients?\nEach time you call .backward PyTorch will add the new gradients to the current gradients, so we need to zero the gradients to prevent them from accumulating.\n32. What information do we have to pass to Learner?\nReference:\nLearner(dls, simple_net, opt_func=SGD,\n            loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\nWe pass to the Learner:\n\nDataLoaders containing training and validation sets.\nThe model we want to train.\nAn optimizer function.\nA loss function.\nAny metrics we want calculated.\n\n33. Show Python or pseudocode for the basic steps of a training loop.\nSee #25.\n34. What is ReLU? Draw a plot for it for values from -2 to +2.\nReLU is Rectified Linear Unit. It’s a function where if the inputs are negative, they are set to zero, and if the inputs are positive, they are kept as is.\n\nplot_function(F.relu, min=-2, max=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35. What is an activation function?\nAn activation function is the function that produces our predictions (in our case, a neural net with linear and nonlinear layers). Sometimes the ReLU is referred to as the activation function.\n36. What’s the difference between F.relu and nn.ReLU?\nF.relu is a function whereas nn.ReLU is a class that needs to be instantiated.\n37. The universal approximation theorem shows that any function can be approximated as closely as needed using just one nonlinearity. So why wo we normally use more?\nUsing more layers results in more accurate models.\n\n\n\nSince this lesson’s Further Research was so intensive, I decided to create separate blog posts for each one:\n\nImplementing a fastai Learner from Scratch\nImplementing an MNIST Classifier from Scratch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs recommended at the end of the lesson 3 video, I will read + run through the code from Jeremy’s notebook Getting started with NLP for absolute beginners before starting lesson 4.\n\nIn this notebook we’ll see how to solve the Patent Phrase Matching problem by treating it as a classification task, by representing it in a very similar way to that shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!pip install kaggle\n\n\n! pip install -q datasets\n\n\n! pip install transformers[sentencepiece]\n\n\n!pip install accelerate -U\n\n\n# for working with paths in Python, I recommend using `pathlib.Path`\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ncred_path = Path('~/.kaggle/kaggle.json').expanduser()\nif not cred_path.exists():\n    cred_path.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n    cred_path.write_text(creds)\n    cred_path.chmod(0o600)\n\n\npath = Path('us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching')\n\n\nimport zipfile,kaggle\nkaggle.api.competition_download_cli(str(path))\nzipfile.ZipFile(f'{path}.zip').extractall(path)\n\nDownloading us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching.zip to /content\n\n\n\n100%|██████████| 682k/682k [00:00&lt;00:00, 750kB/s]\n\n\n\n!ls {path}\n\nsample_submission.csv  test.csv  train.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\n\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nanchor\ntarget\ncontext\nscore\n\n\n\n\n0\n37d61fd2272659b1\nabatement\nabatement of pollution\nA47\n0.50\n\n\n1\n7b9652b17b68b7a4\nabatement\nact of abating\nA47\n0.75\n\n\n2\n36d72442aefd8232\nabatement\nactive catalyst\nA47\n0.25\n\n\n3\n5296b0c19e1ce60e\nabatement\neliminating process\nA47\n0.50\n\n\n4\n54c1e3b9184cb5b6\nabatement\nforest region\nA47\n0.00\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n36468\n8e1386cbefd7f245\nwood article\nwooden article\nB44\n1.00\n\n\n36469\n42d9e032d1cd3242\nwood article\nwooden box\nB44\n0.50\n\n\n36470\n208654ccb9e14fa3\nwood article\nwooden handle\nB44\n0.50\n\n\n36471\n756ec035e694722b\nwood article\nwooden material\nB44\n0.75\n\n\n36472\n8d135da0b55b8c88\nwood article\nwooden substrate\nB44\n0.50\n\n\n\n\n36473 rows × 5 columns\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nDataset description\n\ndf.describe(include='object')\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nanchor\ntarget\ncontext\n\n\n\n\ncount\n36473\n36473\n36473\n36473\n\n\nunique\n36473\n733\n29340\n106\n\n\ntop\n37d61fd2272659b1\ncomponent composite coating\ncomposition\nH01\n\n\nfreq\n1\n152\n24\n2186\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nIn the describe output, freq is the number of rows with the top value in a given column.\n\ndf.query('anchor == \"component composite coating\"').shape\n\n(152, 5)\n\n\nStructure the input data:\n\ndf['input'] = 'TEXT1: ' + df.context + '; TEXT2: ' + df.target + '; ANC1: ' + df.anchor\n\n\ndf.input.head()\n\n0    TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: abatement of pollution; ANC...\n1    TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: act of abating; ANC1: abate...\n2    TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: active catalyst; ANC1: abat...\n3    TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: eliminating process; ANC1: ...\n4    TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: forest region; ANC1: abatement\nName: input, dtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformers use a Dataset object for storing a dataset.

So we need to do two things:\n\nTokenization: Split each text up into words (tokens).\nNumericalization: Convert each word (or token) into a number.\n\nThe details on how this is done depends on the model. So pick a model first:\n\nmodel_nm = 'microsoft/deberta-v3-small'\n\nAutoTokenizer will create a tokenizer appropriate for a given model:\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification,AutoTokenizer\ntokz = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/convert_slow_tokenizer.py:470: UserWarning: The sentencepiece tokenizer that you are converting to a fast tokenizer uses the byte fallback option which is not implemented in the fast tokenizers. In practice this means that the fast version of the tokenizer can produce unknown tokens whereas the sentencepiece version would have converted these unknown tokens into a sequence of byte tokens matching the original piece of text.\n  warnings.warn(\nSpecial tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n\n\nHere’s an example of how the tokenizer splits a text into “tokens” (which are like words, but can be sub-word pieces):\n\ntokz.tokenize(\"G'day folks, I'm Jeremy from fast.ai!\")\n\n['▁G',\n \"'\",\n 'day',\n '▁folks',\n ',',\n '▁I',\n \"'\",\n 'm',\n '▁Jeremy',\n '▁from',\n '▁fast',\n '.',\n 'ai',\n '!']\n\n\nUncommon words will be split into pieces. The start of a new word is represented by _.\n\ntokz.tokenize(\"A platypus is an ornithorhynchus anatinus.\")\n\n['▁A',\n '▁platypus',\n '▁is',\n '▁an',\n '▁or',\n 'ni',\n 'tho',\n 'rhynch',\n 'us',\n '▁an',\n 'at',\n 'inus',\n '.']\n\n\nHere’s a simple function which tokenizes our inputs:\n\ndef tok_func(x): return tokz(x[\"input\"])\n\nTo run this quickly in parallel on every row in our dataset, use map:\n\ntok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True)\n\n\n\n\nThis adds a new item to our dataset called input_ids. For instance, here is the input and IDs for the first row of our data:\n\nrow = tok_ds[0]\nrow['input'], row['input_ids']\n\n('TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: abatement of pollution; ANC1: abatement',\n [1,\n  54453,\n  435,\n  294,\n  336,\n  5753,\n  346,\n  54453,\n  445,\n  294,\n  47284,\n  265,\n  6435,\n  346,\n  23702,\n  435,\n  294,\n  47284,\n  2])\n\n\nThere’s a list called vocab in the tokenizer which contains a unique integer for every possible token string. We can look them up like this, for instance to find the token for the word “of”:\n\ntokz.vocab['▁of']\n\n265\n\n\n265 is present in our input_ids for the first row of data.\n\ntokz.vocab['of']\n\n1580\n\n\nFinally, we need to prepare our labels. Transformers always assumes that your labels has the column name labels, but in our dataset it’s currently score. Therefore, we need to rename it:\n\ntok_ds = tok_ds.rename_columns({'score':'labels'})\n\n\n\n\n\neval_df = pd.read_csv(path/'test.csv')\neval_df.describe()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nanchor\ntarget\ncontext\n\n\n\n\ncount\n36\n36\n36\n36\n\n\nunique\n36\n34\n36\n29\n\n\ntop\n4112d61851461f60\nel display\ninorganic photoconductor drum\nG02\n\n\nfreq\n1\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nThis is the test set. Possibly the most important idea in machine learning is that of having separate training, validation, and test data sets.\n\n\nTo explain the motivation, let’s start simple, and imagine we’re trying to fit a model where the true relationship is this quadratic:\n\ndef f(x): return -3*x**2 + 2*x + 20\n\nUnfortunately matplotlib (the most common library for plotting in Python) doesn’t come with a way to visualize a function, so we’ll write something to do this ourselves:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_function(f, min=-2.1, max=2.1, color='r'):\n    x = np.linspace(min,max, 100)[:,None]\n    plt.plot(x, f(x), color)\n\n\nplot_function(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, perhaps we’ve measured the height above ground of an object before and after some event. The measurements will have some random error. We can use numpy’s random number generator to simulate that. I like to use seed when writing about simulations like this so that I know you’ll see the same thing I do:\n\nfrom numpy.random import normal,seed,uniform\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n\ndef noise(x, scale): return normal(scale=scale, size=x.shape)\ndef add_noise(x, mult, add): return x * (1+noise(x,mult)) + noise(x,add)\n\n\nx = np.linspace(-2, 2, num=20)[:,None]\ny = add_noise(f(x), 0.2, 1.3)\nplt.scatter(x,y);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see what happens if we underfit or overfit these predictions. To do that, we’ll create a function that fits a polynomial of some degree (e.g. a line is degree 1, quadratic is degree 2, cubic is degree 3, etc). The details of how this function works don’t matter too much so feel free to skip over it if you like!\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n\ndef plot_poly(degree):\n    model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree), LinearRegression())\n    model.fit(x, y)\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    plot_function(model.predict)\n\n\nplot_poly(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you see, the points on the red line (the line we fitted) aren’t very close at all. This is under-fit – there’s not enough detail in our function to match our data.\nAnd what happens if we fit a degree 10 polynomial to our measurements?\n\nplot_poly(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell now it fits our data better, but it doesn’t look like it’ll do a great job predicting points other than those we measured – especially those in earlier or later time periods. This is over-fit – there’s too much detail such that the model fits our points, but not the underlying process we really care about.\nLet’s try a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic), and compare it to our “true” function (in blue):\n\nplot_poly(2)\nplot_function(f, color='b')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not bad at all!\nSo, how do we recognise whether our models are under-fit, over-fit, or “just right”? We use a validation set. This is a set of data that we “hold out” from training – we don’t let our model see it at all. If you use the fastai library, it automatically creates a validation set for you if you don’t have one, and will always report metrics (measurements of the accuracy of a model) using the validation set.\nThe validation set is only ever used to see how we’re doing. It’s never used as inputs to training the model.\nTransformers uses a DatasetDict for holding your training and validation sets. To create one that contains 25% of our data for the validation set, and 75% for the training set, use train_test_split:\n\ndds = tok_ds.train_test_split(0.25, seed=42)\ndds\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'labels', 'input', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 27354\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'labels', 'input', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 9119\n    })\n})\n\n\nAs you see above, the validation set here is called test and not validate, so be careful!\nIn practice, a random split like we’ve used here might not be a good idea – here’s what Dr Rachel Thomas has to say about it:\n\n“One of the most likely culprits for this disconnect between results in development vs results in production is a poorly chosen validation set (or even worse, no validation set at all). Depending on the nature of your data, choosing a validation set can be the most important step. Although sklearn offers a train_test_split method, this method takes a random subset of the data, which is a poor choice for many real-world problems.”\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s the validation set explained, and created. What about the “test set” then – what’s that for?\nThe test set is yet another dataset that’s held out from training. But it’s held out from reporting metrics too! The accuracy of your model on the test set is only ever checked after you’ve completed your entire training process, including trying different models, training methods, data processing, etc.\nYou see, as you try all these different things, to see their impact on the metrics on the validation set, you might just accidentally find a few things that entirely coincidentally improve your validation set metrics, but aren’t really better in practice. Given enough time and experiments, you’ll find lots of these coincidental improvements. That means you’re actually over-fitting to your validation set!\nThat’s why we keep a test set held back. Kaggle’s public leaderboard is like a test set that you can check from time to time. But don’t check too often, or you’ll be even over-fitting to the test set!\nKaggle has a second test set, which is yet another held-out dataset that’s only used at the end of the competition to assess your predictions. That’s called the “private leaderboard”.\nWe’ll use eval as our name for the test set, to avoid confusion with the test dataset that was created above.\n\neval_df['input'] = 'TEXT1: ' + eval_df.context + '; TEXT2: ' + eval_df.target + '; ANC1: ' + eval_df.anchor\neval_ds = Dataset.from_pandas(eval_df).map(tok_func, batched=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we’re training a model, there will be one or more metrics that we’re interested in maximising or minimising. These are the measurements that should, hopefully, represent how well our model will works for us.\nIn real life, outside of Kaggle, things not easy… As my partner Dr Rachel Thomas notes in The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI:\n\nAt their heart, what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics. The practice of optimizing metrics is not new nor unique to AI, yet AI can be particularly efficient (even too efficient!) at doing so. This is important to understand, because any risks of optimizing metrics are heightened by AI. While metrics can be useful in their proper place, there are harms when they are unthinkingly applied. Some of the scariest instances of algorithms run amok all result from over-emphasizing metrics. We have to understand this dynamic in order to understand the urgent risks we are facing due to misuse of AI.\n\nIn Kaggle, however, it’s very straightforward to know what metric to use: Kaggle will tell you! According to this competition’s evaluation page, “submissions are evaluated on the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual similarity scores.” This coefficient is usually abbreviated using the single letter r. It is the most widely used measure of the degree of relationship between two variables.\nr can vary between -1, which means perfect inverse correlation, and +1, which means perfect positive correlation. The mathematical formula for it is much less important than getting a good intuition for what the different values look like. To start to get that intuition, let’s look at some examples using the California Housing dataset, which shows “is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars”. This dataset is provided by the excellent scikit-learn library, which is the most widely used library for machine learning outside of deep learning.\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nhousing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)\nhousing = housing['data'].join(housing['target']).sample(1000, random_state=52)\nhousing.head()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedInc\nHouseAge\nAveRooms\nAveBedrms\nPopulation\nAveOccup\nLatitude\nLongitude\nMedHouseVal\n\n\n\n\n7506\n3.0550\n37.0\n5.152778\n1.048611\n729.0\n5.062500\n33.92\n-118.28\n1.054\n\n\n4720\n3.0862\n35.0\n4.697897\n1.055449\n1159.0\n2.216061\n34.05\n-118.37\n3.453\n\n\n12888\n2.5556\n24.0\n4.864905\n1.129222\n1631.0\n2.395007\n38.66\n-121.35\n1.057\n\n\n13344\n3.0057\n32.0\n4.212687\n0.936567\n1378.0\n5.141791\n34.05\n-117.64\n0.969\n\n\n7173\n1.9083\n42.0\n3.888554\n1.039157\n1535.0\n4.623494\n34.05\n-118.19\n1.192\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nWe can see all the correlation coefficients for every combination of columns in this dataset by calling np.corrcoef:\n\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)\n\nnp.corrcoef(housing, rowvar=False)\n\narray([[ 1.  , -0.12,  0.43, -0.08,  0.01, -0.07, -0.12,  0.04,  0.68],\n       [-0.12,  1.  , -0.17, -0.06, -0.31,  0.  ,  0.03, -0.13,  0.12],\n       [ 0.43, -0.17,  1.  ,  0.76, -0.09, -0.07,  0.12, -0.03,  0.21],\n       [-0.08, -0.06,  0.76,  1.  , -0.08, -0.07,  0.09,  0.  , -0.04],\n       [ 0.01, -0.31, -0.09, -0.08,  1.  ,  0.16, -0.15,  0.13,  0.  ],\n       [-0.07,  0.  , -0.07, -0.07,  0.16,  1.  , -0.16,  0.17, -0.27],\n       [-0.12,  0.03,  0.12,  0.09, -0.15, -0.16,  1.  , -0.93, -0.16],\n       [ 0.04, -0.13, -0.03,  0.  ,  0.13,  0.17, -0.93,  1.  , -0.03],\n       [ 0.68,  0.12,  0.21, -0.04,  0.  , -0.27, -0.16, -0.03,  1.  ]])\n\n\nThis works well when we’re getting a bunch of values at once, but it’s overkill when we want a single coefficient:\n\nnp.corrcoef(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)\n\narray([[1.  , 0.68],\n       [0.68, 1.  ]])\n\n\nTherefore, we’ll create this little function to just return the single number we need given a pair of variables:\n\ndef corr(x,y): return np.corrcoef(x,y)[0][1]\n\ncorr(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)\n\n0.6760250732906\n\n\nNow we’ll look at a few examples of correlations, using this function (the details of the function don’t matter too much):\n\ndef show_corr(df, a, b):\n    x,y = df[a],df[b]\n    plt.scatter(x,y, alpha=0.5, s=4)\n    plt.title(f'{a} vs {b}; r: {corr(x, y):.2f}')\n\n\nshow_corr(housing, 'MedInc', 'MedHouseVal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s what a correlation of 0.68 looks like. It’s quite a close relationship, but there’s still a lot of variation. (Incidentally, this also shows why looking at your data is so important – we can see clearly in this plot that house prices above $500,000 seem to have been truncated to that maximum value).\nLet’s take a look at another pair:\n\nshow_corr(housing, 'MedInc', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship looks like it is similarly close to the previous example, but r is much lower than the income vs valuation case. Why is that? The reason is that there are a lot of outliers – values of AveRooms well outside the mean.\nr is very sensitive to outliers. If there’s outliers in your data, then the relationship between them will dominate the metric. In this case, the houses with a very high number of rooms don’t tend to be that valuable, so it’s decreasing r from where it would otherwise be.\nLet’s remove the outliers and try again:\n\nsubset = housing[housing.AveRooms&lt;15]\nshow_corr(subset, 'MedInc', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we expected, now the correlation is very similar to our first comparison.\nHere’s another relationship using AveRooms on the subset:\n\nshow_corr(subset, 'MedHouseVal', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this level, with r of 0.34, the relationship is becoming quite weak.\nLet’s look at one more:\n\nshow_corr(subset, 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you see here, a correlation of -0.2 shows a very weak negative trend.\nWe’ve seen now examples of a variety of levels of correlation coefficient, so hopefully you’re getting a good sense of what this metric means.\nTransformers expects metrics to be returned as a dict, since that way the trainer knows what label to use, so let’s create a function to do that:\n\ndef corr_d(eval_pred): return {'pearson': corr(*eval_pred)}\n\n\n\n\nTo train a model in Transformers we’ll need this:\n\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments,Trainer\n\nWe pick a batch size that fits our GPU, and small number of epochs so we can run experiments quickly:\n\nbs = 128\nepochs = 4\n\nThe most important hyperparameter is the learning rate. fastai provides a learning rate finder to help you figure this out, but Transformers doesn’t, so you’ll just have to use trial and error. The idea is to find the largest value you can, but which doesn’t result in training failing.\n\nlr = 8e-5\n\nTransformers uses the TrainingArguments class to set up arguments. Don’t worry too much about the values we’re using here – they should generally work fine in most cases. It’s just the 3 parameters above that you may need to change for different models.\n\nargs = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n    num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=0.01, report_to='none')\n\nWe can now create our model, and Trainer, which is a class which combines the data and model together (just like Learner in fastai):\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\ntrainer = Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                  tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr_d)\n\n\n\n\nSome weights of DebertaV2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v3-small and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pooler.dense.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias']\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\n\nLet’s train our model!\n\ntrainer.train();\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/optimization.py:411: FutureWarning: This implementation of AdamW is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

The focus generally should be two things:\n\nCreating an effective validation set\nIterating rapidly to find changes which improve results on the validation set.\n\nIf you can do these two things, then you can try out lots of experiments and find what works, and what doesn’t. Without these two things, it will be nearly impossible to do well in a Kaggle competition (and, indeed, to create highly accurate models in real life!)\nThe more code you have, the more you have to maintain, and the more chances there are to make mistakes.

Note that pretrained models assume that text is tokenized in a particular way. In order to ensure that your tokenizer matches your model, use the AutoTokenizer, passing in your model name.\n\ntokz = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll need to combine the context, anchor, and target together somehow. There’s not much research as to the best way to do this, so we may need to iterate a bit. To start with, we’ll just combine them all into a single string. The model will need to know where each section starts, so we can use the special separator token to tell it:\n\nsep = tokz.sep_token\nsep\n\n'[SEP]'\n\n\n\ndf['inputs'] = df.context + sep + df.anchor + sep + df.target\n\nGenerally we’ll get best performance if we convert pandas DataFrames into HuggingFace Datasets, so we’ll convert them over, and also rename the score column to what Transformers expects for the dependent variable, which is label:\n\nds = Dataset.from_pandas(df).rename_column('score', 'label')\neval_ds = Dataset.from_pandas(eval_df)\n\nTo tokenize the data, we’ll create a function (since that’s what Dataset.map will need):\n\ndef tok_func(x): return tokz(x[\"inputs\"])\n\n\ntok_func(ds[0])\n\n{'input_ids': [1, 336, 5753, 2, 47284, 2, 47284, 265, 6435, 2], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nThe only bit we care about at the moment is input_ids. We can see in the tokens that it starts with a special token 1 (which represents the start of text), and then has our three fields separated by the separator token 2. We can check the indices of the special token IDs like so:\n\ntokz.all_special_tokens\n\n['[CLS]', '[SEP]', '[UNK]', '[PAD]', '[MASK]']\n\n\nWe can now tokenize the input. We’ll use batching to speed it up, and remove the columns we no longer need:\n\ninps = \"anchor\",\"target\",\"context\"\ntok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True, remove_columns=inps+('inputs','id','section'))\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the first item of the dataset we should see the same information as when we checked tok_func above:\n\ntok_ds[0]\n\n{'label': 0.5,\n 'input_ids': [1, 336, 5753, 2, 47284, 2, 47284, 265, 6435, 2],\n 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this post, the private test anchors do not overlap with the training set. So let’s do the same thing for our validation set.\nFirst, create a randomly shuffled list of anchors:\n\nanchors = df.anchor.unique()\nnp.random.seed(42)\nnp.random.shuffle(anchors)\nanchors[:5]\n\narray(['time digital signal', 'antiatherosclerotic', 'filled interior',\n       'dispersed powder', 'locking formation'], dtype=object)\n\n\nNow we can pick some proportion (e.g 25%) of these anchors to go in the validation set:\n\nval_prop = 0.25\nval_sz = int(len(anchors)*val_prop)\nval_anchors = anchors[:val_sz]\n\nNow we can get a list of which rows match val_anchors, and get their indices:\n\n# is_val is a boolean array\nis_val = np.isin(df.anchor, val_anchors)\nidxs = np.arange(len(df))\nval_idxs = idxs[ is_val]\ntrn_idxs = idxs[~is_val]\nlen(val_idxs),len(trn_idxs)\n\n(9116, 27357)\n\n\nOur training and validation Datasets can now be selected, and put into a DatasetDict ready for training:\n\ndds = DatasetDict({\"train\":tok_ds.select(trn_idxs),\n             \"test\": tok_ds.select(val_idxs)})\n\nBTW, a lot of people do more complex stuff for creating their validation set, but with a dataset this large there’s not much point. As you can see, the mean scores in the two groups are very similar despite just doing a random shuffle:\n\ndf.iloc[trn_idxs].score.mean(),df.iloc[val_idxs].score.mean()\n\n(0.3623021530138539, 0.3613426941641071)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now train our model! We’ll need to specify a metric, which is the correlation coefficient provided by numpy (we need to return a dictionary since that’s how Transformers knows what label to use):\n\ndef corr(eval_pred): return {'pearson': np.corrcoef(*eval_pred)[0][1]}\n\nWe pick a learning rate and batch size that fits our GPU, and pick a reasonable weight decay and small number of epochs:\n\nlr,bs = 8e-5,128\nwd,epochs = 0.01,4\n\nTransformers uses the TrainingArguments class to set up arguments. We’ll use a cosine scheduler with warmup, since at fast.ai we’ve found that’s pretty reliable. We’ll use fp16 since it’s much faster on modern GPUs, and saves some memory. We evaluate using double-sized batches, since no gradients are stored so we can do twice as many rows at a time.\n\ndef get_trainer(dds):\n    args = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n        num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\n    return Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                   tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\n\nargs = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n    num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n\nWe can now create our model, and Trainer, which is a class which combines the data and model together (just like Learner in fastai):\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\ntrainer = Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n               tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\n\n\n\n\ntrainer.train();\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:02, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.027171\n0.794542\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.026872\n0.811033\n\n\n3\n0.035300\n0.024633\n0.816882\n\n\n4\n0.035300\n0.024581\n0.817413\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now want to start iterating to improve this. To do that, we need to know whether the model gives stable results. I tried training it 3 times from scratch, and got a range of outcomes from 0.808-0.810. This is stable enough to make a start - if we’re not finding improvements that are visible within this range, then they’re not very significant! Later on, if and when we feel confident that we’ve got the basics right, we can use cross validation and more epochs of training.\nIteration speed is critical, so we need to quickly be able to try different data processing and trainer parameters. So let’s create a function to quickly apply tokenization and create our DatasetDict:\n\ndef get_dds(df):\n    ds = Dataset.from_pandas(df).rename_column('score', 'label')\n    tok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True, remove_columns=inps+('inputs','id','section'))\n    return DatasetDict({\"train\":tok_ds.select(trn_idxs), \"test\": tok_ds.select(val_idxs)})\n\n\ndef get_model(): return AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\n\n\ndef get_trainer(dds, model=None):\n    if model is None: model = get_model()\n    args = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n        num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n    return Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                   tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\nPerhaps using the special separator character isn’t a good idea, and we should use something we create instead. Let’s see if that makes things better. First we’ll change the separator and create the DatasetDict:\n\nsep = \" [s] \"\ndf['inputs'] = df.context + sep + df.anchor + sep + df.target\ndds = get_dds(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nget_trainer(dds).train()\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:27, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.027216\n0.799765\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.025568\n0.814325\n\n\n3\n0.031000\n0.023474\n0.817759\n\n\n4\n0.031000\n0.024206\n0.817377\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainOutput(global_step=856, training_loss=0.023552694610346144, metrics={'train_runtime': 207.9058, 'train_samples_per_second': 526.335, 'train_steps_per_second': 4.117, 'total_flos': 582121520370810.0, 'train_loss': 0.023552694610346144, 'epoch': 4.0})\n\n\nThat’s looking quite a bit better, so we’ll keep that change.\n(Vishal note: I trained it a few times but couldn’t get the pearson coefficient past 0.8174)\nOften changing to lowercase is helpful. Let’s see if that helps too:\n\ndf['inputs'] = df.inputs.str.lower()\ndds = get_dds(df)\nget_trainer(dds).train()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [755/856 02:53 &lt; 00:23, 4.33 it/s, Epoch 3.52/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.025207\n0.798847\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.024926\n0.813183\n\n\n3\n0.031800\n0.023556\n0.815640\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:17, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.025207\n0.798847\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.024926\n0.813183\n\n\n3\n0.031800\n0.023556\n0.815640\n\n\n4\n0.031800\n0.024359\n0.815295\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainOutput(global_step=856, training_loss=0.024133934595874536, metrics={'train_runtime': 197.3858, 'train_samples_per_second': 554.386, 'train_steps_per_second': 4.337, 'total_flos': 582121520370810.0, 'train_loss': 0.024133934595874536, 'epoch': 4.0})\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we made the patent section a special token? Then potentially the model might learn to recognize that different sections need to be handled in different ways. To do that, we’ll use, e.g. [A] for section A.

Create a function like the ones above to make that easy for you!\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes while watching this lesson’s video.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the book, we do NLP using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nIn the video, we’re going to be fine-tuning a pretrained NLP model using a library called HuggingFace Transformers.\nIt’s useful to have experience in using more than one library. See the same concepts applied in different ways. Great for understanding the concepts.\nHuggingFace libraries are SOTA in NLP.\nTransformers library in process of being integrated into fastai library.\nHuggingFace Transformers doesn’t have the same layered API as fastai.\n\nFine-Tuning a Pretrained Model\n\nIn the quadratic/sliders example, a pretrained model is like someone telling you that they are confident what parameter a should be, are somewhat confident what b should be, and have no idea what c should be. Then, we would train c until it firts our model, adjust b and keep a as is. That’s what it’s like fine-tuning a pretrained model.\nA pretrained model is a bunch of parameters have already been fit, where for some of them we’re pretty confident of what they should be, and for some of them we really have no idea at all.\nFine-tuning is the process of taking those ones where we have no idea at all what they should be and trying to get them right, and then moving the other ones a little bit.\n\nULMFiT\n\nThe idea of fine-tuning a pretrained NLP model was pioneered by ULMFiT which was first introduced in a fastai course, later turned into an academic paper by Jeremy and Sebastian Ruder which inspired a huge change in NLP capabilities around the world.\nStep 1\n\nBuild a language model using all of Wikipedia that tried to predict the next word of a Wikipedia article. Filling in these kinds of things requires understanding a lot about how language is structured and about the world. Getting good at fitting a language model requires a neural net getting good at a lot of things. It needs to understand language at a reasonably good level, what is true, what is not true, different ways in which things are expressed and so on. Started with random weights. At the end was a model that could predict more than 30% of the time correctly what the next word in a Wikipedia article would be.\n\nStep 2\n\nCreate a second language model, that predicts the next word of a sentence. Took the pretrained model and ran a few more epochs using IMDb movie reviews. So it got very good at predicting the next work of an IMDb movie review.\n\nStep 3\n\nTook those weights and fine-tuned them for the task of predicting whether or not a movie review was positive or negative sentiment.\n\n\nThe first two models don’t require labels. The labels was what’s the next word of the sentence.\nULMFiT built with RNNs.\nTransformers developed at the same time of ULMFiT’s release.\nTransformers can take advantage of modern accelerators like Google’s TPUs.\nTransformers don’t allow you to predict the next word of a sentence, it’s just not how they are structured. Instead they deleted at random a few words and asked the model to predict what words were deleted. The basic concept similar to ULMFiT ,replaced RNN with Transformer. Replaced language model with masked language model.\nHow do you go from a model that’s trained to predict the next word to a model that does classification?\n\nThe first layer of ImageNet classification model finds basic features like diagonal edges, gradients, etc. Layer two combined those (ReLUs added together, activations from sets of ReLUs matrix multipled, etc.)\nLayer 5 had bird and lizard eyeball detectors, dog face detectors, flowers detectors, etc.\nLater layers do things much more specific to the training task.\nPretty unlikely that you need to change the early layers.\nThe layer that says “what is this” is deleted in fine-tuning (the layer that has one output per category). The model is then spitting out a few hundred activations. We stick a new random matrix on top of that and train it, so it can predict what you’re trying to predict. Then we gradually train the rest of the layers.\n\nGetting started with NLP for absolute beginners\n\nUS Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching Competition.\nClassification is probably the most widely use case for NLP.\nDocument = an input to an NLP model that contains text.\nClassifying a document is a rich thing to do: sentiment analysis, author identifiation, legal discovery, organizing documents by topic, triaging inbound emails.\nThe Kaggle competition on US Patents does not immediately look like a classification problem.\nColumns: Anchor, target, context, score\nGoal: come up with a model that automatically determines which anchor and target pairs are talking about the same thing. score = 1.0 means the anchor and target mean the same thing, 0.0 means they are not.\nWhether the anchor and target are determined to be similar or not depends on the context.\nRepresent the problem as &lt;constant string&gt;&lt;anchor&gt;&lt;seperator&gt;&lt;constant string&gt;&lt;target&gt; and choose category 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00.\nKaggle data is already on Kaggle.\nAlways look through the competition’s Data page and read through it before jumping into the data.\nUse DataFrame.describe(include='object') to see stats about the fields (count, unique, top, frequency of top).\nThis dataset contains very small documents (3-4 words) that are not very unique. There’s not a lot of unique data to work with.\nCreate a single string of anchor, target, and context with separators and store as the input column.\nNeural networks work with numbers: We’re going to take the numbers, multiply by matrices, replace negatives with zeros, add them up, and do this a few times.\n\nTokenization: Split each document into tokens (words).\nThe list of unique words is called the vocabulary.\nNumericalization: Each word in the vocabulrary gets a number. The bigger the vocab, the more memory gets used, the more data we need to train. We don’t want a large vocabulary.\nTokenize into sub-words (pieces of words).\n\nWe can turn a pandas DataFrame into a Huggingface dataset’s Dataset using Dataset.from_pandas.\nWhatever pretrained model you used comes with a tokenizer. Before you start tokenizing, you have to decide on which model to use.\nHugginface Model Hub has pretrained models trained on specific corpuses.\nThere are some generally good models, deberta-v3 is one of those.\nNLP has been practically effective for general users for only a year or two, a lot of this stuff we’re figuring out as a community.\nAlways start with a small model, it’s faster to train, we’re going to be able to do more iterations.\nAutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&lt;model name&gt;) will download the vocab and details about how this particular model tokenized the dataset.\n_ represents the start of a word.\ndef tok_func(x): return tokx(x['input']) takes a document x, and tokenizes it’s input.\nDataset.map will parallelize the process of calling the function on each value. batched=True will do a bunch at a time. Tokenizer library is an optimized Rust library.\ninput_ids will contain numbers in the position of each of the tokens.\nHow do you choose the keywords and the order of the fields when creating input?\n\nIt’s arbitrary, try a few things. We just want something it can learn from that separates one field from another.\n\nIf one of the fields was long (1000 characters) is there any special handling required there?\n\nLong documents in ULMFiT require no special consideration. ULMFiT is the best approach for large documents. It will split large documents into pieces.\nLarge documents are challening for Transformers. It does the whole document at once.\nDocuments over 2000 words: look at ULMFiT.\nUnder 2000 words: Transformers should be fine unless you have a laptop GPU with not much memory.\n\nHuggingFace transformers expect that your target is a column called labels.\ntest.csv doesn’t have a score field.\nPerhaps the most important idea in machine learning is having separate training, validation and test datasets.\nTest and validation sets are all about identifying and controlling for overfitting.\nUnderfit: not enough complexity in the model fit to match the data that’s there. It’s systematically biased.\nCommon misunderstanding is that simpler models are more reliable in some way, but models that are too simple will be systematically incorrect.\nOverfit: it’s done a good job of fitting our data points, but if we sample some more data points from our distribution the model won’t be close to them.\nUnderfitting is easy to recognize (we can look at training data and see that it’s not very close).\nOverfitting is harder to recognize because the training data is very close.\nHow do we tell if we have a good fit that’s not overfitting? We measure how good our model is by looking ONLY at the points we set aside as the validation set.\nfast.ai won’t let you train a model without a validation set and shows metrics only on the validation set.\nCreating a good validation set is not generally as simple as just randomly pulling some of your data out of the data that you train your model on.\nKaggle is a great place to learn how to create a good validation set.\nA test set is another validation set that you don’t use for metrics. Helps you see if you overfit using the validation set.\nKaggle has two test sets: leaderboard feedback during competition and second test set that is private until after competition is finished.\nDon’t accidentally find a model that is good by coincidence. Only if you have a test set that you hold out will you know if you’ve done this.\nIf your model is terrible on the test set—go back to square one.\nYou don’t want functions with gradient of 0 of inf (like accuracy) you want something smooth.\nOne metric is not enough to capture all of the real world dynamics involved in a model’s use.\nGoodhart’s law: when a measure becomes a target, it’s ceases to be a good measure.\nAI is really good at optimizing metrics so you have to be careful what metrics you choose for models that are used in real life (impacting people’s lives).\nPearson correlation coefficient is the most widely used measure of how similar two variables are\n\n-1.0 to +1.0.\nAbbreviated as r.\n\nHow do I plot datasets with far too many points? The answer is: get less points (sample).\nnp.corrcoef gives a diagonally symmetric matrix of r values.\nVisualizing your data is important so you can see things like how data is truncated.\nalpha=0.5 for scatter plots creates darker areas where there’s lots of dots.\nr relies on the square of the difference, big outliers increase that by a lot.\nr is very sensitive to outliers.\nIf you’re trying to win a Kaggle competition that uses r and even a couple of your rows are really wrong, it will be a disaster.\nYou almost can’t see the relationship for \\(r=0.34\\)\nTransformers expects metric to be returned as a dict.\ntok_ds.train_test_split() returns a DatasetDict({train: Dataset, test: Dataset}).\nTransformers calls it validation set test, on which is calculates metrics.\nThe fastai equivalent of Learner is the HuggingFace Transformer’s Trainer.\nThe larger the batch size, the more you can do in parallel and the faster it’ll be, but if it’s too large you’ll get an out-of-memory error on the GPU.\nIf you’re using a framework that doesn’t have a learning rate finder like fastai, you can just start with a really low learning rate and then keep doubling it until it falls apart.\nTrainingArguments is a class that takes all of the configuration (like learning rate, warmup ratio, scheduler type, weight decay, etc.).\nYou always want fp16=True as it will be faster.\nAutoModelForSequenceClassification will create an model for classification, .from_pretrained will use a pretrained model which has a num_labels param which is the number of output columns we have, which in this case is 1 (the score).\nTrainer takes the model, the training and validation data, TrainingArguments(), tokenizer and metrics).\nTrainer.train() will train the model.\nHuggingFace is very verbose, the warnings which you can ignore.\nThe only reason we get a high r value after 4 epochs is because we used a pretrained model.\nThe pretrained model already knows a lot about language and has a good sense of whether two phrases have the same meaning or not.\nHow do you decide when it’s okay to remove outliers?\n\nOutliers should never just be removed for modelling.\nInstead we would observe that clearly from looking at this dataset, these two groups can’t be treated the same way (low income/high # of rooms vs. high income/high # of rooms). Split them into two separate analyses.\nOutlier exists in a statistical sense, it doesn’t exist in a real sense (i.e. things that we should ignore or throw away). Some of the most useful insights in data projects are digging into outliers and understanding what are they? and where did they come from? It’s in those edge cases where you discover really important things like when processes go wrong, labelling problems. Never delete outliers. Investigate them, have a strategy about what you’re going to do with them.\n\nTraining with HuggingFace’s Transformer is similar to the things we’ve seen before with fastai.\ntrainer.predict(eval_ds).predictions.astype(float) to get predictions from Trainer object.\nAlways look at your outputs. So you can see things like having negative predictions or predictions over 1, which are outside the range of the patent phrase matching score. For now, we can at least round these off up to 0 and down to 1, respectively, better ways to do this but this is better than nothing.\nKaggle expects submissions to generally be in a CSV file.\nNLP is probably where the biggest opportunities are for big wins in research and commercialization.\n\nIt’s worth thinking about both use and misuse of modern NLP.\nYou can create bots to generate context appropriate conversation and scale it up to 99% of Twitter and nobody would know. This is worrying because a lot of how people see the world is coming out of social media conversation, which at this point are contrallable. It would not be that hard to create something that’s optimized towards moving a point of view amongst a billion people in a very subtle way, very gradually over a long period of time by multiple bots each pretending to argue with each other and one of them getting the upper hand and so forth.\nWhat GPT is used for we may not know for decades, if ever.\n2017: millions of submissions to the FTC about Net Neutrality very heavily biased against it. An analysis showed that something like 99% of them were auto-generated. We don’t know for sure but this seems successful because repealing Net Neutrality went through, the comments were factored into this decision.\nYou can always create a generative model that beats bot classifiers designed to classify its content as auto-generated. Similar problem with spam prevention.\nIf you pass num_labels=1 to AutoModelForSequenceClassification it treats it as a regression problem.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes and run code examples from Chapter 10: NLP Deep Dive: RNNs in the textbook.\n\nIn general, in NLP the pretrained model is trained on a different task.\nlanguage model: a model that has been trained to guess the next word in a text (having read the ones before).\nself-supervised learning: Training a model using labels that are embedded in the independent variable, rather than requiring external labels.\nTo properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the natural language.\nSelf-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning.\nSelf-supervised learning and computer vision\nEven if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting.\nYou get even better results if you fine-tune the sequence-based language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model.\nThe IMDb dataset contains 100k movie reviews (50k unlabeled, 25k labeled training set reviews, 25k labeled validation set reviews). We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles, this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review. This is known as Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT).\nThe extra stage of fine-tuning the language model, prior to transfer learning to classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions.\n\n\n\n\nUsing categorical variables as independent variables for a neural network:\n\nMake a list of all possible levels of that categorical variable (the vocab).\nReplace each level with its index in the vocab.\nCreate an embedding matrix for this containing a row for each level (i.e., for each item of the vocab).\nUse this embedding matrix as the first layer of a neural network. (A dedicated embedding matrix can take as inputs the raw vocab indexes created in step 2; this is equivalent to, but faster and more efficient than, a matrix that takes as input one-hot-encoded vectors representing the indexes).\n\nWe can do nearly the same thing with text:\n\nFirst we concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one big long string and split it into words (or tokens), giving us a very long list of words.\nOur independent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the first word in our very long list and ending with the second to last, and our dependent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the second word and ending with the last word.\nOur vocab will consist of a mix of common words that are already in the vocabulary of our pretrained model and new words specific to our corpus.\nOur embedding matrix will be built accordingly: for words that are in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, we will take the corresponding row in the embedding matrix of the pretrained model; but for new words, we won’t have anything, so we will just initialize the corresponding row with a random vector.\n\nSteps for creating a language model:\n\nTokenization: convert the text into a list of words (or characters, or substrings, depending on the granularity of your model)\nNumericalization: List all of the unique words that appear (vocab) and convert each word into a number by looking up its index in the vocab.\nLanguage model data loader creation: fastai’s LMDataLoader automatically handles creating a dependent variable that is offset from the independent variable by one token, and handles important details liks shuffling the training data so that the dependent and independent variables maintain their structure as required.\nLanguage model creation: we need a model that handles input lists that could be arbitrarily big or small. We use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\n\n\n\n\nThere is no one approach to tokenization. There are three main approaches:\n\nWord-based: Split a sentence on spaces and separate parts of meaning even when there are no spaces (“don’t” -&gt; “do n’t”). Punctuation marks are generally split into separate tokens.\nSubword based: Split words into smaller parts, based on the most commonly occurring substrings (“occasion” -&gt; “o c ca sion”).\nCharacter-based: Split a sentence into its individual characters.\n\n\n\n\nRather than providing its own tokenizers, fastai provides a consistent interface to a range of tokenizers in external libraries.\nLet’s try it out with the IMDb dataset:\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [144441344/144440600 00:02&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#7) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_lm'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/imdb.vocab'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/test'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_clas'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/README')]\n\n\nget_text_files gets all the text files in a path\n\nfiles = get_text_files(path, folders = ['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\n\n\nfiles[:10]\n\n(#10) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/42765_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/19120_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/8649_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/32022_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/30143_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/14876_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/28162_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/32133_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/21844_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/830_0.txt')]\n\n\nHere’s a review that we will tokenize:\n\ntxt = files[0].open().read(); txt[:75]\n\n\"Despite some humorous banter and a decent supporting cast, I can't really r\"\n\n\nWordTokenizer will always point to fastai’s current default word tokenizer.\nfastai’s coll_repr(collection, n) displays the first n items of collection, along with the full size.\n\ntokz = WordTokenizer()\ntoks = first(tokz([txt]))\nprint(coll_repr(toks, 30))\n\n(#243) ['Despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','I','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','The','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','I','did',\"n't\",'particularly','care'...]\n\n\nTokenization is a surprisingly subtle task. “.” is separated when it terminates a sentence but not in an acronym or number:\n\nfirst(tokz(['The U.S. dollar $1 is $1.00.']))\n\n(#9) ['The','U.S.','dollar','$','1','is','$','1.00','.']\n\n\nfastai adds some functionality to the tokenization process with the Tokenizer class:\n\ntkn = Tokenizer(tokz)\nprint(coll_repr(tkn(txt), 31))\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','i','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','xxmaj','the','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','i','did',\"n't\"...]\n\n\nTokens that start with xx are special tokens.\nxxbos is a special token that indicates the start of a new text (“BOS” is a standard NLP acronym that means “beginning of stream”). By recognizing this start token, the model will be able to learn it needs to “forget” what was said previously and focus on upcoming words. These special tokens don’t come from the external tokenizer. fastai adds them by default by applying a number of rules when processing text. These rules are designed to make it easier for a model to recognize the important parts of a sentence. We are translating the original English language sequence into a simplified tokenized language that is designed to be easy for a model to learn.\nFor example, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a single exclamation point follow by a special repeated character token and then the number four.\n\ntkn('!!!!')\n\n(#4) ['xxbos','xxrep','4','!']\n\n\nIn this way, the model’s embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repititions of every punctuation mark. A capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word so the embedding matrix needs only the lowercase version of the words saving compute and memory resources but can still learn the concept of capitalization.\nHere are some of the main special tokens:\nxxbos: Indicates the beginning of a text (in this case, a review).\nxxmaj: Indicates the next word begins with a capital.\nxxunk: Indicates the next word is unknown.\n\ndefaults.text_proc_rules\n\n[&lt;function fastai.text.core.fix_html(x)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_rep(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_wrep(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.spec_add_spaces(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.rm_useless_spaces(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_all_caps(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_maj(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.lowercase(t, add_bos=True, add_eos=False)&gt;]\n\n\nfix_html: replaces special HTML characters with a readable version.\nreplace_rep: Replaces any character repeated three times or more with a special token for repetition (xxrep), the number of times it’s repeated, then the character.\nreplace_wrep: Replaces any word repeated three times or more with a special token for word repetition (xxwrep), the number of times it’s repeated, then the character.\nspec_add_spaces: adds spaces around / and #.\nrm_useless_spaces: Removes all repetitions of the space character.\nreplace_all_caps: Lowercases a word written in all caps and adds a special token for all caps (xxcap) in front of it.\nreplace_maj: Lowercases a capitalized word and adds a special token for capitalized (xxmaj) in front of it.\nlowercase: Lowercases all text and adds a special token at the beginning (xxbos) and/or the end (xxeos).\n\ncoll_repr(tkn(\"&copy;    Fast.ai www.fast.ai/INDEX\"), 31)\n\n\"(#11) ['xxbos','©','xxmaj','fast.ai','xxrep','3','w','.fast.ai','/','xxup','index']\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWord tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However this assumption is not always appropriate. Languages like Chinese and Japanese don’t use spaces. Turkish and Hungarian can add many subwords together without spaces.\nTwo steps of subword tokenization:\n\nAnalyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occuring groups of letters. These becomes the vocab.\nTokenize the corpus string using this vocab of subword units.\n\n\ntxts = L(o.open().read() for o in files[:2000])\n\n\n! pip install sentencepiece\ndef subword(sz):\n  sp = SubwordTokenizer(vocab_sz=sz)\n  sp.setup(txts)\n  return ' '.join(first(sp([txt]))[:40])\n\nsetup reads the documents and finds the common sequences of characters to create the vocab.\n\nsubword(1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"▁De s p ite ▁some ▁humor ous ▁b ant er ▁and ▁a ▁de cent ▁support ing ▁cast , ▁I ▁can ' t ▁really ▁recommend ▁this ▁movie . ▁The ▁lead s ▁are n ' t ▁very ▁li k able ▁and ▁I\"\n\n\nWhen using fastai’s subword tokenizer, _ represents a space character in the original text.\nIf we use a smaller vocab, each token will represent fewer characters and it will take more tokens to represent a sentence.\n\nsubword(200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'▁ D es p it e ▁ s o m e ▁h u m or o us ▁b an ter ▁and ▁a ▁ d e c ent ▁ s u p p or t ing ▁ c a s t'\n\n\nIf we use a larger vocab, most common English words will end up in the vocab themselves, and we will not need as many to represent a sentence:\n\nsubword(10000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"▁Des pite ▁some ▁humorous ▁ban ter ▁and ▁a ▁decent ▁support ing ▁cast , ▁I ▁can ' t ▁really ▁recommend ▁this ▁movie . ▁The ▁leads ▁are n ' t ▁very ▁likable ▁and ▁I ▁didn ' t ▁particular ly ▁care ▁if ▁they\"\n\n\nA larger vocab means fewer tokens per sentence, which means faster training, less memory and less state for the model to remember; but on the downside, it means larger embedding matricces, which require more data to learn.\nSubword tokenization provides a way to easily scale between character tokenization (using a small subword vocab) and word tokenization (using a large subword vocab) and handles every human language. It can even handle genomic sequences or MIDI music notation. It’s likely to become (or has already) the most common tokenization approach.\n\n\n\nNumericalization is the process of mapping tokens to integers.\n\nMake a list of all possible levels of the categorical variable (the vocab).\nReplace each level with its index in the vocab.\n\n\ntoks = tkn(txt)\nprint(coll_repr(tkn(txt), 31))\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','i','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','xxmaj','the','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','i','did',\"n't\"...]\n\n\nJust like with SubwordTokenizer, we need to call setup on Numericalize to create the vocab. That means we’ll need our tokenized corpus first:\n\ntoks200 = txts[:200].map(tkn)\ntoks200[0]\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting'...]\n\n\n\nnum = Numericalize()\nnum.setup(toks200)\ncoll_repr(num.vocab, 20)\n\n\"(#2200) ['xxunk','xxpad','xxbos','xxeos','xxfld','xxrep','xxwrep','xxup','xxmaj','the','.',',','and','a','of','to','is','in','i','it'...]\"\n\n\nOur special rules tokens appear first, and then every word appears once in frequency order.\nThe defaults to Numericalize are min_freq=3 and max_vocab=60000. max_vocab results in fastai replacing all words other than the most common 60,000 with a special unknown word token, xxunk. This is useful to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, since that can slow down training and use up too much memory, and can also mean that there isn’t enough data to train useful representations for rare words (better handles by setting min_freq, any word appearing fewer than it is replaced with xxunk).\nfastai can also numericalize your dataset using a vocab that you provide, by passing a list of words as the vocab parameter.\nThe Numericalizer object is used like a function:\n\nnums = num(toks)[:20]; nums\n\nTensorText([  2,   8, 418,  68,   0,   0,  12,  13, 618, 419, 190,  11,  18,\n            259,  38,  93, 445,  21,  28,  10])\n\n\nWe can check that the integers map back to the original text:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in nums)\n\n\"xxbos xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want our language model to read text in order, so that it can efficiently predict what the next word is, this means each new batch should begin precisely where the previous one left off.\nAt the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the order of the documents to make a new stream.\nWe then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our batch size). For example, if the stream has 50,000 tokens as we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000…) because we want the model to read continuous rows of text. An xxbos token is added at the start of each text during preprocessing, so that the model knowns when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\nFirst apply our Numericalize object to the tokenized texts:\n\nnums200 = toks200.map(num)\n\nThen pass it to the LMDataLoader:\n\ndl = LMDataLoader(nums200)\n\n\nx,y = first(dl)\nx.shape, y.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 72]), torch.Size([64, 72]))\n\n\n\nx[:1], y[:1]\n\n(LMTensorText([[   2,    8,  418,   68,    0,    0,   12,   13,  618,  419,  190,\n                  11,   18,  259,   38,   93,  445,   21,   28,   10,    8,    9,\n                 693,   42,   38,   72, 1274,   12,   18,   81,   38,  479,  420,\n                  58,   47,  305,  274,   17,    9,  135,   10,   18,  619,   81,\n                  38,   49,    9,  221,  120,  221,   47,  305,  274,   11,   29,\n                   8,    0,    8, 1275,  783,   74,   59,  446,   15,   43,    9,\n                   0,  285,  114,    0,   24,    0]]),\n TensorText([[   8,  418,   68,    0,    0,   12,   13,  618,  419,  190,   11,\n                18,  259,   38,   93,  445,   21,   28,   10,    8,    9,  693,\n                42,   38,   72, 1274,   12,   18,   81,   38,  479,  420,   58,\n                47,  305,  274,   17,    9,  135,   10,   18,  619,   81,   38,\n                49,    9,  221,  120,  221,   47,  305,  274,   11,   29,    8,\n                 0,    8, 1275,  783,   74,   59,  446,   15,   43,    9,    0,\n               285,  114,    0,   24,    0,   30]]))\n\n\nLooking at the first row of the independent variable:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in x[0][:20])\n\n\"xxbos xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie .\"\n\n\nWhich is the start of the text.\nThe dependent variable is the same thing offset by one token:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in y[0][:20])\n\n\"xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie . xxmaj\"\n\n\nWe are now ready to train our text classifier.\n\n\n\n\nTwo steps to training a state-of-the-art text classifier using transfer learning:\n\nFine-tune our language model pretrained on Wikipedia to the corpus of IMDb reviews.\nUse that model to train a classifier.\n\n\n\nfastai handles tokenization and numericalization automatically when TextBlock is passed to DataBlock.\n\nget_imdb = partial(get_text_files, folders=['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\n\ndls_lm = DataBlock(\n    blocks=TextBlock.from_folder(path, is_lm=True),\n    get_items=get_imdb,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.1)\n).dataloaders(path, path=path, bs=128, seq_len=80)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom_folder tells TextBlock how to access the texts so that it can do initial preprocessing. fastai performs a few optmizations:\n\nIt saves the tokenized documents in a temporary folder, so it doesn’t have to tokenize them more than once.\nIt runs multiple tokenization processes in parallel, to take advantage of your computer’s CPUs.\n\n\ndls_lm.show_batch(max_n=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\ntext_\n\n\n\n\n0\nxxbos xxmaj caught this at xxmaj cinequest . xxmaj it was well attended , but the crowd seemed disappointed . xxmaj in my humble opinion , \" charlie the xxmaj ox \" was very amateurish and overrated ( it pales in comparison with other cinequest pics i saw ) . xxmaj acting ( with the exception of xxmaj polito ) seemed self -

The second batch’s first mini-stream is a continuation of the first batch’s first mini-stream. In this case, the first mini-stream of the second batch also contains the start of the next movie review (document) as indicated by the xxbos special token.\n\n\n\nTo convert the integer word indices into activations that we can use for our neural network, we will use embeddings. We feed those embeddings into a recurrent neural network (RNN) using an architecture called AWS-LSTM.\nThe embeddings in the pretrained model are merged with random embeddings added for words that weren’t in the pretraining vocabulary.\n\nlearn = language_model_learner(\n    dls_lm,\n    AWD_LSTM,\n    drop_mult=0.3,\n    metrics=[accuracy, Perplexity()]\n).to_fp16()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [105070592/105067061 00:00&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\nThe loss function used by default is cross-entropy loss, since we essentially have a classification problem (the different categories being the words in our vocab).\nPerplexity is a metric often used in NLP for language models. It is the exponential of loss (i.e., torch.exp(cross_entropy)).\nlanguage_model_learner automatically calls freeze when using a pretrained model (which is the default) so this will train only the embeddings (the part of the model that contains randomly initialized weights—embeddings for the words that are in our IMDb vocab, but aren’t in the pretrained model vocab).\nI wasn’t able to train my model on Google Colab (I got a ran out of memory error even for small batches) so I trained the IMDb language model on Paperspace and wrote a separate blog post about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven simple algorithms could be used to create fraudulent accounts and try to influence policymakers (99% of the 2017 Net Neutrality public comments were likely faked).\nMany people assume or hope that algorithms will come to our defense here, the problem is that this will always be an arms race, in which better classification (or discriminator) algorithms can be used to create better generation algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n1. What is self-supervised learning?\nSelf-supervised learning is when you train a model on data that does not contain any external labels. Instead, the labels are embedded in the independent variable.\n2. What is a language model?\nA language model is a model that predicts the next word based on the previous words in a text.\n3. Why is a language model considered self-supervised?\nBecause we do not train the model with external labels. The dependent variable is the next token in a sequence of previous tokens (independent variable).\n4. What are self-supervised models usually used for?\nPretraining a model that will be used for transfer learning.\n5. Why do we fine-tune language models?\nIn order for it to learn the style of language used in our specific corpus.\n6. What are the three steps to create a state-of-the-art text classifier?\n\nTrain a language model on a large general corpus like Wikipedia.\nFine-tune a language model using your task-specific corpus.\nFine-tune a classifier using the encoder of the twice-pretrained language model.\n\n7. How do the 50,000 unlabeled movie reviews help create a better text classifier for the IMDb dataset?\nThe 50k unlabeled movie reviews help create a better text classifier for the IMDb dataset because when you fine-tune the pretrained Wikipedia language model using this data, the model learns the particular style and content of IMDb movie reviews, which helps it better understand what the language used in the reviews means when classifying it as positive or negative.\n8. What are the three steps to prepare your data for a language model?\n\nTokenization: convert the text into a list of words (or characters or substrings).\nNumericalization: List all of the words that appear (the vocab) and convert each word into a number by looking up its index in the vocab.\nLanguage model data loader creation: combine the documents into one string and split it into fixed sequence length batches while preserving the order of the tokens, create a dependent variable that is offset from the independent variable by one token, and shuffle the training data (maintaining independent/dependent variable structure).\n\n9. What is tokenization? Why do we need it?\nTokenization is the conversion of text into smaller parts (like words, subwords or characters). In order to convert our documents into numbers (categories) that the language model can learn something about, we first tokenize them (break them into smaller parts) so that we can generate a list of unique tokens (unique levels of a categorical variable) contained in the corpus (categorical variable).\n10. Name three approaches to tokenization.\n\nword-based: split a sentence based on spaces.\nsubword based: split words into commonly occurring substrings.\ncharacter-based: split a sentence into its individual characters.\n\n11. What is xxbos?\nA special token that tells the language model that we are at the start of a new stream (document).\n12. List four rules that fastai applies to text during tokenization.\nI’ll list them all:\n\nfix_html: replace special HTML characters (like &copy—the copyright symbol) with a readable version.\nreplace_rep: replace repeated characters with a special token for repetition (xxrep), the number of times it’s repeated, and then the character.\nreplace_wrep: do the same as replace_rep but for repeated words (using the special token xxwrep).\nspec_add_spaces: add spaces around / and #.\nrm_useless_spaces: remove all repetitions of the space character.\nreplace_all_caps: lowercase all-caps words and place a special token xxcap in front of it.\nreplace_maj: lowercase a capitalized word and place a special token xxmaj in front of it.\nlowercase: lowercase all text and place a special token at the beginning (xxbos) and/or at the end (xxeos).\n\n13. Why are repeated characters replaced with a token showing the number of repetitions and the character that’s repeated?\nSo that the model’s embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation without requiring a unique token for every number of repetitions of a character.\n14. What is numericalization?\nConverting a token to a number by looking up its index in the vocab (unique list of all tokens).\n15. Why might there be words that are replaced with the “unknown word” token?\nIn order to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, fastai’s numericalization replaces two types of words with with the unknown word token xxunk:\n\nWords that appear less than min_freq times.\nWords that are not in the max_vocab most frequent words.\n\nFor example, if min_freq = 3 then all words that appear once or twice are replaced with xxunk.\nIf max_vocab = 60000 then words the appear less frequently than the 60000th most frequent word are replaced with xxunk.\n16. With a batch size of 64, the first row of the tensor representing the first batch contains the first 64 tokens for the dataset. What does the second row of that tensor contain?\nThe second row contains 64 tokens of the (n/b/s+1)th group of tokens where n is the number of tokens, divided by the number of batches b divided by the sequence length s. So, if we have 90 tokens divided into 6 batches (rows) with a sequence length (columns) of 5, then the second row of the first batch contains the 4th (i.e., 3 + 1) group of tokens.\nPutting Tanishq’s answer here as well:\n\nThe dataset is split into 64 mini-streams (batch size).\nEach batch has 64 rows (batch size) and 64 columns (sequence length).\nThe first row of the first batch contains the beginning of the first mini-stream (tokens 1-64).\nThe second row of the first batch contains the beginning of the second mini-stream.\nThe first row of the second batch contains the second chunk of the first mini-stream (tokens 65 - 128).\n\n17. Why do we need padding for text classification? Why don’t we need it for language modeling?\nWhen the data is prepared for language modeling, the documents are concatenated into a single string and broken up into equally-sized batches, so there is no need to pad any batches—they’re already the right size.\nIn the case of text classification, each document is maintained in full length in a batch, and documents will very likely have a varying number of tokens (i.e., everyone is not writing the same length of movie reviews with the same number of special tokens) so in each batch, all of the documents (except the largest) will need to be padded to the batch’s largest document’s size. fastai sorts the data by length each epoch and groups together documents of similar lengths for each batch before applying the padding.\nSomething that I would like to understand however is:\nWhat if the number of tokens in the training dataset is not divisible by the selected batch size and sequence length? Does fastai use padding in that case? Suppose you have 1000 tokens in total, a batch size of 16 and sequence length of 20. 320 goes into 1000 3 times with a remainder. Does fastai create a 4th batch with padding? Or remove the tokens so there’s only 3 batches? I’ll see if I can figure out what it does with some sample code:\n\nbs,sl = 5, 2\nints = L([[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]]).map(tensor)\n\n\ndl = LMDataLoader(ints, bs=bs, seq_len=sl)\n\nlist(dl)\n\n[(LMTensorText([[0, 1],\n                [2, 3],\n                [4, 5],\n                [6, 7],\n                [8, 9]]),\n  tensor([[ 1,  2],\n          [ 3,  4],\n          [ 5,  6],\n          [ 7,  8],\n          [ 9, 10]]))]\n\n\n\nlist(LMDataLoader(ints, bs=bs, seq_len=sl, drop_last=False))\n\n[(LMTensorText([[0, 1],\n                [2, 3],\n                [4, 5],\n                [6, 7],\n                [8, 9]]),\n  tensor([[ 1,  2],\n          [ 3,  4],\n          [ 5,  6],\n          [ 7,  8],\n          [ 9, 10]]))]\n\n\nLooks like fastai drops the last batch if it’s not full. I’ve posted this question in the fastai forums to get a confirmation on my understanding.\n18. What does an embedding matrix for NLP contain? What is its shape?\nIt contains the parameters that are trained by the neural net, with each parameter corresponding to each token in the vocab.\nFrom Tanishq’s solutions:\n\nThe embedding matrix has the size (vocab_size x embedding_size) where vocab_size is the length of the vocabulary, and embedding_size is an arbitrary number defining the number of latent factors of the tokens.\n\n19. What is perplexity?\nA metric used in NLP. It is the exponential of the loss.\n20. Why do we have to pass the vocabulary of the language model to the classifier data block?\nThe indexes corresponding to the tokens have to be maintained because we are fine-tuning the language model.\n21. What is gradual unfreezing?\nWhen we train one layer at a time for one epoch before we unfreeze and train the full model (including all layers of the encoder).\n22. Why is text generation always likely to be ahead of automatic identification of machine-generated texts?\nBecause text generation models can be trained to beat automatic identification algorithms.\n\n\n\n1. See what you can learn about language models and disinformation. What are the best language models today? Take a look at some of their outputs. Do you find them convincing? How could a bad actor best use such a model to create conflict and uncertainty?\n\nHere is a tweet thread by Arvind Narayan talking about how the danger of ChatGPT is that “you can’t tell when it’s wrong unless you already know the answer”.\nThis New York Times article walks through different examples of ChatGPT responding to prompts with disinformation.\nThis NewsGuard article, which was referenced in the NYT article, discusses how ChatGPT-4 is more prone to perpetuating misinformation than its predecessor GPT-3.5. GPT-3.5 generated 80 of 100 false narratives given as prompts while GPT-4 generated 100 of 100 false narratives. Also, “ChatGPT-4’s responses that contained false and misleading claims were less likely to include disclaimers about the falsity of those claims (23% of the time) [than ChatGPT-3.5 (51% of the time)].\nThis NBC New York article walks through an example of how a ChatGPT written story on Michael Bloomberg was full of made-up quotes and sources. It also talks about how some educators are embracing ChatGPT in the classroom, and while ineffective, there are machine-generated text identification algorithms available. Although it’s important to note, as disussed in the fastai course, that text generation models will always be ahead of automatic identification models (generative models can be trained to beat identification models).\nIn this Harvard Business School Working Knowledge article Scott Van Voorhiss and Tsedal Neeley summarise the story of how Dr. Timnit Gebru went from Ethiopia, to Boston, to a PhD at Stanford, and co-lead of Google AI Ethics, later to be fired when because she co-authored a paper that asked for companies to hold off on building large language models until we figured out how to handle the bias perpetuated by these models.\n\nThe article’s authors use these events as a case study to learn from when handling issues of ethics in AI.\n\n“The biggest message I want to convey is that AI can scale bias in ways that we can barely understand today”.\n“in failing to give Gebru the independence to do her job, might have sacrificed an opportunity to become a global leader in responsible AI development”.\nFinally, in this paper the authors test detection tools for AI-generated text in academic settings. “The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated text”. Across the 14 tools, the highest average accuracy was less than 80%, with 50% for AI-generated/human-edited text and 26% for machine-paraphrased AI-generated text.\n\n2. Given the limitation that models are unlikely to be able to consistently recognize machine-generated texts, what other approaches may be needed to handle large-scale disinformation campaigns that leverage deep learning?\nThe first thing that comes to mind is Glaze by the University of Chicago which “works by understanding the AI models that are training on human art, and using machine learning algorithms, computing a set of minimal changes to artworks, such that it appears unchanged to human eyes, but appears to AI models like a dramatically different art style…So when someone then prompts the model to generate art mimicking the charcoal artist, they will get something quite different from what they expected.”\nI can’t imagine how something analogous to Glaze can be created for language, since plain text is just plain text, but conceptually, if human-written language is altered in a similar way, then it will be prevented from being generated similarly by LLMs like GPT. This would effect not just LLMs but anyone training their model on such altered data, but perhaps that is a cost worth having to prevent the perpetuation of copyrighted or disinformation content.\nAnother idea is that disinformation detection may benefit from a human-in-the-loop. AI-generated content that is not identified automatically may be identified by a human as disinformation. A big enough sample of accounts spreading this misinformation may lead to identifying broader trends in which accounts are fake."

Treat this as a very simple “model” in which our predictions are simply the average sale price of the item’s group.\nAfter looping through all of the columns and all the possible levels for each, pick the split point that gave the best predictions using that simple model.\nWe now have two groups for our data, based on this selected split. Treat each group as a separate dataset, and find the best split for each by going back to step 1 for each group.\nContinue this process recursively, until you have reached some stopping criterion for each group–for instance, stop splitting a group further when it has only 20 items in it.\n\nI’ll implement the algorithm on my own, then compare it with the algorithm Jeremy implemented in the Lesson 6 video, and the sklearn.DecisionTreeRegressor."

    "text": "Decision Tree Algorithm: Before Watching Lesson 6\nI haven’t watched the Lesson 6 video yet, and am assuming that Jeremy walks through how to build a decision tree from scratch in that video, so I’m trying it out first on my own. To be honest, I’m a bit embarrassed to publish this part of my learning process, since my approach is not very elegant, but I’d like to show what my current thinking is and then compare it with what I understand after learning the formal solution to this algorithm.\nI’ll start by creating a mean squared error function to calculate at each split:\n\ndef mse(pred, y): return ((pred-y)**2).mean()\n\n\n# root mse and value\nmse(y, y.mean()), y.mean()\n\n(0.48205692, 10.104347)\n\n\nI’ll walk through the algorithm step-by-step manually for a couple of columns before I create any functions or loops.

I’ll use a small dataset for this procedure since the loops require too much time (more than an hour) when I use the full dataset:\n\nxs_sub = xs.sample(1000, random_state=42)\ny_sub = y[xs_sub.index]\n\n\nbest_splits = []\nfor column in xs_sub.columns:\n  if column in to.cat_names:\n    best_splits.append([column, get_cat_best_split(xs_sub, y_sub, column)])\n  if column in to.cont_names:\n    best_splits.append([column, get_cont_best_split(xs_sub, y_sub, column)])\n\n\nbest_splits\n\n[['UsageBand', [0, [0.4289803, 0.5418442]]],\n ['fiModelDesc', [1082, [0.0, 0.45956165]]],\n ['fiBaseModel', [72, [0.0, 0.45933586]]],\n ['fiSecondaryDesc', [139, [0.0010413192, 0.45947686]]],\n ['fiModelSeries', [22, [0.0018927432, 0.45957345]]],\n ['fiModelDescriptor', [138, [0.0011120219, 0.45861065]]],\n ['ProductSize', [6, [0.17651369, 0.45974725]]],\n ['fiProductClassDesc', [59, [0.0028960933, 0.4587686]]],\n ['state', [15, [0.024394397, 0.45930827]]],\n ['ProductGroup', [3, [0.10852089, 0.39364752]]],\n ['ProductGroupDesc', [3, [0.10852089, 0.39364752]]],\n ['Drive_System', [2, [0.0733325, 0.49420977]]],\n ['Enclosure', [3, [0.30207962, 0.37955183]]],\n ['Forks', [2, [0.28580874, 0.4628031]]],\n ['Pad_Type', [4, [0.01935081, 0.46220613]]],\n ['Ride_Control', [1, [0.10788533, 0.53090215]]],\n ['Stick', [1, [0.08875317, 0.49070317]]],\n ['Transmission', [3, [0.037590597, 0.4595029]]],\n ['Turbocharged', [2, [0.043661047, 0.46277064]]],\n ['Blade_Extension', [1, [0.6090261, 0.43294448]]],\n ['Blade_Width', [2, [0.21063821, 0.45938253]]],\n ['Enclosure_Type', [1, [0.09410498, 0.45690852]]],\n ['Engine_Horsepower', [2, [0.08047946, 0.45704415]]],\n ['Hydraulics', [7, [0.00222363, 0.4558903]]],\n ['Pushblock', [2, [0.17637664, 0.4491221]]],\n ['Ripper', [1, [0.3071829, 0.4566584]]],\n ['Scarifier', [0, [0.43313345, 0.59920347]]],\n ['Tip_Control', [0, [0.43313345, 0.59920347]]],\n ['Tire_Size', [6, [0.003916449, 0.45774794]]],\n ['Coupler', [0, [0.35867354, 0.54620147]]],\n ['Coupler_System', [2, [0.10629387, 0.45753148]]],\n ['Grouser_Tracks', [2, [0.033831615, 0.45868516]]],\n ['Hydraulics_Flow', [0, [0.39364752, 0.10852089]]],\n ['Track_Type', [1, [0.2580127, 0.45796755]]],\n ['Undercarriage_Pad_Width', [4, [0.08790448, 0.459086]]],\n ['Stick_Length', [21, [0.03558779, 0.45946068]]],\n ['Thumb', [2, [0.23120114, 0.4605685]]],\n ['Pattern_Changer', [2, [0.4319223, 0.45872542]]],\n ['Grouser_Type', [1, [0.4383151, 0.45913604]]],\n ['Backhoe_Mounting', [0, [0.46665692, 0.3895407]]],\n ['Blade_Type', [10, [0.0015298143, 0.4583235]]],\n ['Travel_Controls', [4, [0.0022710091, 0.45842946]]],\n ['Differential_Type', [3, [0.008903191, 0.4579678]]],\n ['Steering_Controls', [2, [0.39570603, 0.46438074]]],\n ['saleIs_month_end', [1, [0.46104407, 0.36129642]]],\n ['saleIs_month_start', [1, [0.46031126, 0.39876112]]],\n ['saleIs_quarter_end', [1, [0.4600184, 0.33042803]]],\n ['saleIs_quarter_start', [1, [0.45814824, 0.48365197]]],\n ['saleIs_year_end', [1, [0.45866725, nan]]],\n ['saleIs_year_start', [1, [0.45866725, nan]]],\n ['auctioneerID_na', [1, [0.45774823, 0.46984664]]],\n ['MachineHoursCurrentMeter_na', [2, [0.41661143, 0.51914454]]],\n ['SalesID', [1144455, [0.008310286, 0.45859787]]],\n ['MachineID', [17776, [0.003757841, 0.4595788]]],\n ['ModelID', [36033, [0.45857352, 0.0010936307]]],\n ['datasource', [132, [0.43562403, 0.49841937]]],\n ['auctioneerID', [0.0, [0.34691957, 0.45884383]]],\n ['YearMade', [1974, [0.3009956, 0.46007067]]],\n ['MachineHoursCurrentMeter', [14856.0, [0.459368, 0.2509487]]],\n ['saleYear', [1989, [0.09763114, 0.45981508]]],\n ['saleMonth', [8, [0.44693333, 0.48317593]]],\n ['saleWeek', [50, [0.45991018, 0.35147443]]],\n ['saleDay', [30, [0.4608025, 0.2767068]]],\n ['saleDayofweek', [4, [0.4637312, 0.39367497]]],\n ['saleDayofyear', [10, [0.0038693824, 0.45864925]]],\n ['saleElapsed', [607910400.0, [0.0004528304, 0.45936278]]]]\n\n\n\nlowest_mse = 10000\nfor split in best_splits:\n  if len(split[1]) &gt;

I’ll be looking for these answers when watching the Lesson 6 video."

    "text": "Decision Tree Algorithm: After Watching Lesson 6\nThe algorithm presented in the Lesson 6 video(from Jeremy’s notebook How random forests really work) evaluates a split based on a weighted standard deviation calculation.\nFor a given condition (for example Age &lt;= 6) Jeremy calculates the following:\n\nA “side score” which is the product of the standard deviation of the dependent variable and number of rows for rows that satisfy the condition.\nA side score for the rows that don’t satisfy the condition.\nThe sum of both side scores divided by the number of total rows in the dependent variable column.\n\nThen for each column, he calculates the side score for splits at each unique value of the column and gets the minimum score (and corresponding split value). The column (and corresponding value) with the split that has the smallest score is determined as the best split.\nConceptually: the column (and value) where the weighted standard deviation is the smallest is the column where a split on that value will create two groups where within each group there will be dependent variable values that are relatively close to each other.\nI’ll start by coding the _side_score function Jeremy defined, which calculates the product of the standard deviation of the dependent variable and number of rows in the give split side:\n\ndef _side_score(side, y):\n    tot = side.sum()\n    if tot&lt;=1: return 0\n    return y[side].std()*tot\n\nNext, the function score which calculates the sum of each side’s _side_score divided by the total number of rows, or in other words, the weighted average of each side’s standard deviation:\n\ndef score(col, y, split):\n    lhs = col&lt;=split\n    return (_side_score(lhs,y) + _side_score(~lhs,y))/len(y)\n\nI’ll reload the data so and take the same subset as above so I can compare the splits this algorithm makes to the ones made previously:\n\nto = load_pickle(\"to.pkl\")\n\n\nxs,y = to.train.xs, to.train.y\nvalid_xs, valid_y = to.valid.xs, to.valid.y\n\n\nxs_sub = xs.sample(1000, random_state=42)\ny_sub = y[xs_sub.index]\n\n\nmse(y_sub, y_sub.mean()), y_sub.mean()\n\n(0.45866725, 10.109871)\n\n\n\nscore(xs['UsageBand'], y, 2)\n\n0.6922498415264088\n\n\nI’ll walk through each step of the score calculation manually to visualize it better.\nFirst we create a boolean array of rows that satisfy or don’t satisfy the condition:\n\nlhs = xs['UsageBand'] &lt;= 2\n\n\nlhs\n\n0          True\n1          True\n2          True\n3          True\n4         False\n          ...  \n412693     True\n412694     True\n412695     True\n412696     True\n412697     True\nName: UsageBand, Length: 404710, dtype: bool\n\n\nNext: for how many columns is the condition met?\n\ntot = lhs.sum()\ntot\n\n370444\n\n\nWhat is the standard deviation of the dependent variable for rows where the condition is met?\n\ny[lhs].std()\n\n0.69022495\n\n\nFinally, what is the side score for this condition?\n\nside_score_lhs = y[lhs].std()*tot\nside_score_lhs\n\n255689.68972754478\n\n\nWe ask the same questions for the rows where the condition is NOT met:\n\ntot = (~lhs).sum()\ntot\n\n34266\n\n\n\ny[~lhs].std()\n\n0.71414065\n\n\n\nside_score_rhs = y[~lhs].std()*tot\nside_score_rhs\n\n24470.743636608124\n\n\nFinally, we add the two side scores together and divide by the number of total rows:\n\n(side_score_lhs + side_score_rhs) / len(y)\n\n0.6922498415264088\n\n\nThankfully, this is equal to the output from the function _side_score! I’ll continue by getting the code for calculating this score for splits on each of the unique values in a column:\n\ndef min_col(xs, nm, y):\n    col = xs[nm]\n    unq = col.dropna().unique()\n    scores = np.array([score(col, y, o) for o in unq if not np.isnan(o)])\n    idx = scores.argmin()\n    return unq[idx],scores[idx]\n\nLet’s test it out on UsageBand:\n\nmin_col(xs, 'UsageBand', y)\n\n(0, 0.6921555579861831)\n\n\nAgain, I’ll go line-by-line through the code of min_col to make sure I understand what’s going on:\n\ncol = xs['UsageBand']\ncol\n\n0         2\n1         2\n2         1\n3         1\n4         3\n         ..\n412693    0\n412694    0\n412695    0\n412696    0\n412697    0\nName: UsageBand, Length: 404710, dtype: int8\n\n\nWhat are the unique values in this column?\n\nunq = col.dropna().unique()\nunq\n\narray([2, 1, 3, 0], dtype=int8)\n\n\nIf we split the data on each of the unique values, what is the score for each split?\n\nscores = np.array([score(col, y, o) for o in unq if not np.isnan(o)])\nscores\n\narray([0.69224984, 0.69378292, 0.69430405, 0.69215556])\n\n\nWhat is the minimum score, and what value does it correspond to?\n\nidx = scores.argmin()\nidx\n\n3\n\n\n\nunq[idx], scores[idx]\n\n(0, 0.6921555579861831)\n\n\nNext, I’ll iterate through all of the columns in the data and calculate the minimum score (and corresponding value) for each one. I’ll use the smaller subset of the data since the list comprehension was taking more than an hour to compute on the full dataset.\n\ncol_scores = {o: min_col(xs_sub, o, y_sub) for o in xs_sub.columns}\n\n\ncol_scores\n\n{'UsageBand': (0, 0.6710787683725357),\n 'fiModelDesc': (150, 0.6684566705226899),\n 'fiBaseModel': (30, 0.66775039935112),\n 'fiSecondaryDesc': (15, 0.6461849688887596),\n 'fiModelSeries': (60, 0.6612360656261445),\n 'fiModelDescriptor': (9, 0.6385975532531738),\n 'ProductSize': (0, 0.649804151058197),\n 'fiProductClassDesc': (7, 0.6468342208862304),\n 'state': (52, 0.6769107410311699),\n 'ProductGroup': (3, 0.6413102557659149),\n 'ProductGroupDesc': (3, 0.6413102557659149),\n 'Drive_System': (3, 0.6595019570589066),\n 'Enclosure': (3, 0.6443507042527199),\n 'Forks': (0, 0.6468727025985718),\n 'Pad_Type': (0, 0.6484307520389557),\n 'Ride_Control': (0, 0.6693848296999931),\n 'Stick': (0, 0.6484307520389557),\n 'Transmission': (6, 0.6698495596647263),\n 'Turbocharged': (0, 0.6484307520389557),\n 'Blade_Extension': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Blade_Width': (2, 0.665115752696991),\n 'Enclosure_Type': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Engine_Horsepower': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Hydraulics': (0, 0.6497658799290658),\n 'Pushblock': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Ripper': (0, 0.6618279729485512),\n 'Scarifier': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Tip_Control': (0, 0.6660390158891678),\n 'Tire_Size': (3, 0.6607923060655594),\n 'Coupler': (2, 0.6719830477237702),\n 'Coupler_System': (0, 0.5992864975929261),\n 'Grouser_Tracks': (0, 0.5992864975929261),\n 'Hydraulics_Flow': (0, 0.5992864975929261),\n 'Track_Type': (1, 0.6633642191886902),\n 'Undercarriage_Pad_Width': (5, 0.6722126321792603),\n 'Stick_Length': (1, 0.6726506268978119),\n 'Thumb': (0, 0.6727646491527557),\n 'Pattern_Changer': (0, 0.6727646491527557),\n 'Grouser_Type': (0, 0.6727646491527557),\n 'Backhoe_Mounting': (0, 0.6719208754301071),\n 'Blade_Type': (5, 0.6712375184893609),\n 'Travel_Controls': (2, 0.6719208754301071),\n 'Differential_Type': (0, 0.6718101676702499),\n 'Steering_Controls': (0, 0.6718101676702499),\n 'saleIs_month_end': (1, 0.6775472568273544),\n 'saleIs_month_start': (1, 0.6773856681585312),\n 'saleIs_quarter_end': (1, 0.6774418947696685),\n 'saleIs_quarter_start': (2, 0.6775886416435242),\n 'saleIs_year_end': (1, 0.6775886416435242),\n 'saleIs_year_start': (1, 0.6775886416435242),\n 'auctioneerID_na': (2, 0.6775886416435242),\n 'MachineHoursCurrentMeter_na': (1, 0.6731610369682312),\n 'SalesID': (1614635, 0.6669842964410782),\n 'MachineID': (1010754, 0.6537257554531097),\n 'ModelID': (4336, 0.6421609473228455),\n 'datasource': (132, 0.674677339553833),\n 'auctioneerID': (1.0, 0.674844207584858),\n 'YearMade': (1974, 0.6595817529559136),\n 'MachineHoursCurrentMeter': (3360.0, 0.6672791358232498),\n 'saleYear': (1991, 0.6751361751556396),\n 'saleMonth': (4, 0.6770030355453491),\n 'saleWeek': (17, 0.6766363668441773),\n 'saleDay': (10, 0.6758146023750305),\n 'saleDayofweek': (4, 0.6748345303535461),\n 'saleDayofyear': (10, 0.6763967939466238),\n 'saleElapsed': (688348800.0, 0.6746526069641113)}\n\n\nI’ll then find the split across all columns with the lowest score:\n\nmin_col_score = min(col_scores.values())\nmin_col_names = [key for key in col_scores if col_scores[key] == min_col_score]\n\n\nmin_col_score, min_col_names\n\n((0, 0.5992864975929261),\n ['Coupler_System', 'Grouser_Tracks', 'Hydraulics_Flow'])\n\n\nThe lowest score was around the split of &lt;=0 for three columns, which interestingly enough, were found to be redundant features in the textbook chapter.

To improve this, I would either explicitly ignore splits with low samples or penalize such splits by weighting by number of rows like Jeremy did in _side_score.\nThe sklearn.DecisionTreeRegressor had the same initial split as Jeremy’s (on Coupler_System) but then chose two completely different columns to split on for the remainder of the leaf nodes. I wonder if this difference in column selection is due to the difference in how a split is scored between those two algorithms.\nA future improvement I could make to this experiment is compare the MSE on a validation set for each decision tree.\nAnother future improvement would be to make my algorithm and Jeremy’s algorithm run faster so that I can test it on the actual dataset in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThis was another challenging and enjoyable “Further Research” exercise provided by the fastai textbook.

Then, take the mean of all batch accuracy values as the accuracy for the epoch:\n\ndef validate_epoch(model):\n  accs = [batch_accuracy(model(xb), yb) for xb,yb in valid_dl]\n  return round(torch.stack(accs).mean().item(), 4)\n\n\n\nCreate a Function for the Training Loop\ntrain_model takes a model, and number of epochs that you want to train the model for as inputs. For each epoch, it trains the model on the training set batches, and outputs the epoch’s metric on the validation set batches:\n\ndef train_model(model, epochs):\n  for i in range(epochs):\n    train_epoch(model)\n    print(validate_epoch(model), end=' ')\n\n\n\nTrain the Model\nAs is done in the text, I’ll train the model for 40 epochs.\n\ntrain_model(simple_net, 40)\n\n0.5127 0.8013 0.9175 0.9419 0.957 0.9653 0.9672 0.9677 0.9687 0.9702 0.9726 0.9736 0.9745 0.9755 0.9755 0.9765 0.977 0.9785 0.9785 0.9785 0.9795 0.9799 0.9804 0.9809 0.9809 0.9814 0.9819 0.9819 0.9819 0.9824 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 0.9829 \n\n\nI get a similar starting and final accuracy as the example from the text."

    "text": "Constructing a DataBlock\nA DataBlock can be used to create Datasets from which DataLoaders can be created to use during training. A DataBlock is an object which contains the data and has helper functions which can access and transform the data.\nThey start by creating an empty DataBlock\n\ndblock = DataBlock()\ndblock\n\n&lt;fastai.data.block.DataBlock at 0x7efe5c559d90&gt;\n\n\nThe DataFrame with filenames and labels can be fed to the DataBlock to create a Datasets object, which is &gt; an iterator that contains a training Dataset and validation Dataset\nEach dataset is\n\na collection that returns a tuple of your independent and dependent variable for a single item\n\nA Dataet created from an empty DataBlock (meaning, a DataBlock with no helper functions to tell it how the data is structured and accessed) will contain a tuple for each row of the DataFrame, where both values of the tuple are the same row.\n\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(fname                   005618.jpg\n labels      tvmonitor chair person\n is_valid                      True\n Name: 2820, dtype: object, fname                   005618.jpg\n labels      tvmonitor chair person\n is_valid                      True\n Name: 2820, dtype: object)\n\n\nWhat we want is for the DataBlock to create Datasets of (independent, dependent) values. In this case, the independent variable is the image and the dependent variable is a list of labels.\nIn order to parse the DataFrame rows, we need to provide two helper functions to the DataBlock: get_x and get_y. In ordert to convert them to the appropriate objects that will be used in training, we need to provide two more arguments: ImageBlock and MultiCategoryBlock. In order for the DataBlock to correctly split the data into training and validation datasets, we need to define a splitter function and pass it as an argument as well.\nget_x will access the filename from each row of the DataFrame and convert it to a file path.\nget_y will access the labels from each row and split them into a list.\nImageBlock will take the file path and convert it to a PILImage object.\nMultiCategoryBlock will convert the list of labels to a one-hot encoded tensor using the Dataset’s vocab.\nsplitter will explicitly choose for the validation set the rows where is_valid is True.\nRandomResizedCrop will ensure that each image is the same size, which is a requirement for creating a tensor with all images.\n\ndef get_x(row): return path/'train'/row['fname']\ndef get_y(row): return row['labels'].split(' ')\ndef splitter(df):\n  train = df.index[~df['is_valid']].tolist()\n  valid = df.index[df['is_valid']].tolist()\n  return train, valid\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n    splitter=splitter,\n    get_x=get_x,\n    get_y=get_y,\n    item_tfms = RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.35))\n\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(df)\ndsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x333,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.,\n         0., 0.]))\n\n\nThe Datasets vocab is a list of alphabetically ordered unique labels:\n\ndsets.train.vocab\n\n['aeroplane', 'bicycle', 'bird', 'boat', 'bottle', 'bus', 'car', 'cat', 'chair', 'cow', 'diningtable', 'dog', 'horse', 'motorbike', 'person', 'pottedplant', 'sheep', 'sofa', 'train', 'tvmonitor']\n\n\nLet me breakdown the tuple returned by dsets.train[0]. The first value is a PILImageobject which can be viewed by calling its show() method:\n\ndsets.train[0][0].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second value is a one-hot encoded list, where 1s are in the location of the labels in the corresponding vocab list. I’ll use the torch.where method to access the indices where there are 1s:\n\ntorch.where(dsets.train[0][1]==1)\n\n(TensorMultiCategory([6]),)\n\n\n\ndsets.train.vocab[torch.where(dsets.train[0][1]==1)[0]]\n\n(#1) ['car']\n\n\n\ndls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=3)"

    "text": "Chapter 4: Two-Digit MNIST Classifier\nI’ll first review the loss function used in the single-label classification models created in Chapters 4 and 5 before reviewing Binary Cross Entropy Loss introduced in this chapter.\nIn this chapter, we built a image classifier which would predict if an input image was an of the digit 3 or the digit 7.\nThe target (or expected outcome) is a list of 0s (for 7) and 1s (for 3). If we gave a batch of images of a 3, a 7 and a 3, the target would be [1, 0, 1].\nSuppose the model predicted the following values: [0.9, 0.4, 0.2] where each value represented the probability or confidence it had that each image was a 3.\nLoss represents the positive difference between the target and the prediction: - 1 - prediction when target == 1 - prediction when target == 0\nFor the first image, the model had 90% confidence it was a 3, and it was indeed a 3. The loss is 1 - 0.9 = 0.1.\nFor the second second image, the model had a 40% confidence it was a three, and the image was of a 7. The loss is 0.4.\nFor the last image, the model had a 20% confidence it was a 3, and the image was a 3. The loss is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\nThe average of these three losses is 1.3/3 or 0.433.\nThe following cell illustrates this with code:\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\ntargets = tensor([1,0,1])\npredictions = tensor([0.9, 0.4, 0.2])\nmnist_loss(predictions=predictions, targets=targets)\n\ntensor(0.4333)\n\n\nThe assumption that this loss function makes is that the predictions are always between 0 and 1. That may not always be true! In order to make this assumption explicit, we take the sigmoid of the prediction before calculating the loss. The sigmoid function outputs a value between 0 and 1 for any input value.\n\ntensor([0.4,-100,200]).sigmoid()\n\ntensor([0.5987, 0.0000, 1.0000])\n\n\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  predictions = predictions.sigmoid()\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()"

    "text": "Chapter 5: 37 Breed Pet Classifier\nIn this chapter, we train an image classifier that when given an input image, predicts which of the 37 pet breeds the image shows. The loss function needs to handle 37 activations for each image. In order to ensure the sum of those activations equals 1.0—so that the highest activation represents the model’s highest confidence—the softmax function is used. In order to increase the separation between probabilities, the softmax function’s output is passed through the logarithm function, and the negative value is taken. The combination of softmax and (negative) logarithm is called cross entropy loss.\nSuppose we had 4 images in a batch.

    "text": "Binary Cross Entropy Loss\nThe authors begin the discussion of explaining the multi-label classification model loss function by observing the activations from the trained model. I’ll do the same—I love that approach since it grounds the concepts involved in the construction of loss function in the actual model outputs.\n\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18)\n\nDownloading: \"https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet18-5c106cde.pth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx, y = dls.train.one_batch()\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    learn.model.cuda()\nactivs = learn.model(x)\nactivs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 20])\n\n\nEach batch has 64 images and each of those images has 20 activations, one for each label in .vocab. Currently, they are not restricted to values between 0 and 1.\nNote: the activations tensor has to first be placed on the cpu and then detached from the graph (which is used to track and calculate gradients of the weights with respect to the loss function) before it can be converted to a numpy array used for the plot.\n\nys = activs[0].cpu().detach().numpy()\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Vocab Index\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Activation\")\nplt.xticks(np.arange(20), np.arange(20))\nplt.bar(range(20), ys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing them through a sigmoid function achieves that:\n\nys = activs[0].sigmoid().cpu().detach().numpy()\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Vocab Index\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Activation\")\nplt.xticks(np.arange(20), np.arange(20))\nplt.bar(range(20), ys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe negative log of the activations is taken in order to push the differences between loss values. For vocab where the target is 1, -log(inputs) is calculated. For vocab where the target is 0, -log(1-inputs) is calculated. This seems counterintuitive at first, but let’s take a look at the plot of these functions:\n\nys = -activs[0].sigmoid().log().cpu().detach().numpy()\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Vocab Index\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Activation\")\nplt.xticks(np.arange(20), np.arange(20))\nplt.bar(range(20), ys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sigmoid activations that were very close to 0 (Vocab Index = 0, 2, 5, and 16) are now much larger than those that were very close to 1 (Vocab Index = 6, 14, and 18). Since the target is 1, this correctly assigns a larger loss to the inaccurate predictions and the smaller loss to the accurate ones. We can say the same (but opposite) for -log(1-inputs), which is used when the target is 0.:\n\nys = -(1- activs[0].sigmoid()).log().cpu().detach().numpy()\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Vocab Index\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Activation\")\nplt.xticks(np.arange(20), np.arange(20))\nplt.bar(range(20), ys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the mean of all image loss values is taken for the batch. The Binary Cross Entropy Function look likes this:\n\ndef binary_cross_entropy(inputs, targets):\n  inputs = inputs.sigmoid()\n  return -torch.where(targets==1, inputs, 1-inputs).log().mean()\n\nThe inputs (the activations for each vocab value)) is the first value and the targets of each image are the second value of the dls.train.one_batch() tuple.\n\nbinary_cross_entropy(activs,y)\n\nTensorMultiCategory(1.0472, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=&lt;AliasBackward&gt;)\n\n\nI will compare this with the built-in function F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits and function class nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss to make sure I receive the same result.\n\nF.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(activs,y)\n\nTensorMultiCategory(1.0472, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=&lt;AliasBackward&gt;)\n\n\n\nnn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()(activs,y)\n\nTensorMultiCategory(1.0472, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=&lt;AliasBackward&gt;)"

Census Tracts in Urban areas, like the Minneapolis, will likely have more workers than Rural areas, because they have a higher population.

There are four coordinates of interest: left, upper, right and bottom. The leftmost points on the image are assigned a pixel value of 0. The rightmost points are located at the image width pixel pixel value. The uppermost points are at pixel 0, and the bottommost points are at the image height pixel value.\n\nf = \"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/fastai-course-v4/images/test/grizzly_black.png\"\nimg = PILImage.create(f)\nimg.to_thumb(320)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop-Left Corner Crop\nA top-left corner crop the corresponds to a left pixel of 0, upper pixel 0, right pixel of 224, and bottom pixel of 224. The order in the tuple is left, upper, right, bottom, so 0, 0, 224, 224. You can see that this crop is taken from the top left corner of the original image.\n\nimg.crop((0,0,224,224))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Right Corner Crop\nFor the top right corner, I get the image width since the left end of the crop will be 224 pixels from the right end of the image. That translates to w-224. The upper pixel is 0, and the rightmost pixel is at w, and the bottom pixel is 224. You can see that this crop is at the top right corner of the original.\n\nw = img.width\nh = img.height\nimg.crop((w-224, 0, w, 224))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Right Corner Crop\nFor the bottom right corner the left pixel is 224 from the right end, w-224, the upper pixel is 224 from the bottom, h-224, the right pixel is at w, and the bottom is at h.\n\nimg.crop((w-224, h-224, w, h))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Left Corner Crop\nThe bottom left corner’s leftmost pixel is 0, uppermost pixel is 224 pixels from the bottom of the whole image, h - 224, the rightmost pixel is 224, and bottommost pixel is the bottom of the whole image, at h.\n\nimg.crop((0, h-224, 224, h))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter Crop\nFinally, for the center crop, the leftmost pixel is 112 left of the image center, w/2 - 112, the upper pixel is 112 above the image center, h/2 - 112, the rightmost pixel is 112 right of the center, w/2 + 112, and the bottom pixel is 112 below the center, h/2 + 112.\n\nimg.crop((w/2-112, h/2-112, w/2+112,h/2+112))\n\n\n\nSummary\nTo better visualize this, here are a couple of images which show the left, upper, right and bottom coordinates for the corner and center crops.\nSummary of corner crop arguments (left, upper, right, bottom)\n\n\n\ncrop_dimensions-01.png\n\n\nSummary of center crop arguments (left, upper, right, bottom)\n\n\n\ncenter_crop_dimensions-01.png\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine a function which takes an image and returns a stacked Tensor with four corner crops and a center crop\nI wrap those five lines of code into a function called corner_crop, which takes a PILImage img, and a square side length size (defaulted to 224) as its arguments. It first grabs the width and height of the image. And then goes on to save the crops of the four corners and center as TensorImages, returning them all in a single stacked Tensor.\n\ndef corner_crop(img, size=224):\n  \"\"\"Returns a Tensor with 5 cropped square images\n  img: PILImage\n  size: int\n  \"\"\"\n  w,h = img.width, img.height\n  top_left = TensorImage(img.crop((0,0,size,size)))\n  top_right = TensorImage(img.crop((w-size, 0, w, size)))\n  bottom_right = TensorImage(img.crop((w-size, h-size, w, h)))\n  bottom_left = TensorImage(img.crop((0, h-size, size, h)))\n  center = TensorImage(img.crop((w/2-size/2, h/2-size/2, w/2+size/2,h/2+size/2)))\n  return torch.stack([top_left, top_right, bottom_right, bottom_left, center])\n\nI’ll test the corner_crop function and make sure that the five images are cropped correctly.\nHere’s the top left corner.\n\nimgs = corner_crop(img)\n\n# Top Left Corner Crop\nimgs[0].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop right corner:\n\n# Top Right Corner Crop\nimgs[1].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom right:\n\n# Bottom Right Corner Crop\nimgs[2].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom left:\n\n# Bottom Left Corner Crop\nimgs[3].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd center:\n\n# Center Crop\nimgs[4].show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine a new CornerCrop transform by extending the Transform class definition\nThe main purpose for all of that was for me to wrap my head around how the crop behavior functions so that I can wrap that into a transform.\nTransforms are any function that you want to apply to your data. I’ll extend the base Transform class and add in the functionality I need for these crops. When an object of the CornerCrop class is constructed, the constructor takes size and corner_type arguments. Since I’ll use this within a for-loop, the corner_type argument is an integer from 0 to 3, corresponding to the loop counter. The transform is applied to the data during the .encodes method. I grab the original image width and height, and create a list of cropped images using the left, upper, right, bottom coordinates we saw above. Finally, based on the corner_type, the corresponding crop is returned.\n\nclass CornerCrop(Transform):\n    \"Create 4 corner and 1 center crop of `size`\"\n    def __init__(self, size, corner_type=0, **kwargs):\n      self.size = size\n      self.corner_type = corner_type\n\n    def encodes(self, x:(Image.Image,TensorBBox,TensorPoint)):\n      self.w, self.h = x.size\n      self.crops = [\n                    x.crop((0,0,self.size, self.size)),\n                    x.crop((self.w - self.size, 0, self.w, self.size)),\n                    x.crop((self.w-self.size, self.h-self.size, self.w, self.h)),\n                    x.crop((0, self.h-self.size, self.size, self.h))\n                    ]\n      return self.crops[self.corner_type]\n\nTo test this transform, I created an image with top left, top right, bottom right and bottom left identified. I created multiple copies so that I can create batches.\n\n# test image for CornerCrop\npath = Path('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/fastai-course-v4/images/test/corner_crop_images')\nImage.open((path/'01.jpg'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI create a DataBlock and pass my CornerCrop to the item_tfms parameter. I’ll cycle through the different corner types. 0 corresponds to top left, 1 is top right, 2 is bottom right and 3 is bottom left. All images in my batch should be cropped to the same corner.\nI set corner_type to 0, build the DataBlock and DataLoaders and the batch shows top left.\n\n# get the data\n# path = untar_data(URLs.IMAGENETTE)\npath = Path('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/fastai-course-v4/images/test/corner_crop_images')\n\n# build the DataBlock and DataLoaders using CornerCrop\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n                   get_items=get_image_files,\n                   get_y=parent_label,\n                   item_tfms=CornerCrop(224,0))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(path, bs=4)\n\n# view a batch\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI set corner_type to 1, build the DataBlock and DataLoaders and the batch shows top right.\n\n# build the DataBlock and DataLoaders using CornerCrop\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n                   get_items=get_image_files,\n                   get_y=parent_label,\n                   item_tfms=CornerCrop(224,1))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(path, bs=4)\n\n# view a batch\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI set corner_type to 2, build the DataBlock and DataLoaders and the batch shows bottom right.\n\n# build the DataBlock and DataLoaders using CornerCrop\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n                   get_items=get_image_files,\n                   get_y=parent_label,\n                   item_tfms=CornerCrop(224,2))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(path, bs=4)\n\n# view a batch\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI set corner_type to 3, build the DataBlock and DataLoaders and the batch shows bottom left.\n\n# build the DataBlock and DataLoaders using CornerCrop\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n                   get_items=get_image_files,\n                   get_y=parent_label,\n                   item_tfms=CornerCrop(224,3))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(path, bs=4)\n\n# view a batch\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I can implement this transform into a new TTA method.\n\n\nDefine a new Learner.corner_crop_tta method by repurposing the existing Learner.tta definition\nI’ll largely rely on the definition of tta in the built-in Learner class. In this method, predictions are calculated on four sets of augmented data (images) and then averaged along with predictions on a center-crop dataset.\nIn the existing for-loop, four sets of predictions on randomly generated crops are appended into a list.\nfor i in self.progress.mbar if hasattr(self,'progress') else range(n):\n  self.epoch = i #To keep track of progress on mbar since the progress callback will use self.epoch\n  aug_preds.append(self.get_preds(dl=dl, inner=True)[0][None])\nIn my loop, I create a new DataLoader each time, passing a different corner_type argument to the CornerCrop transform. I also have to pass the ToTensor transform, so that the PIL Image is converted to a Tensor. In the first iteration, it will append predictions on the top left corner crops. In the next one, it will append predictions on the top right, then the bottom right, and finally on the fourth loop, the bottom left.\naug_preds = []\nfor i in range(4):\n  dl = dls[1].new(after_item=[CornerCrop(224,i), ToTensor])\n  #self.epoch = i #To keep track of progress on mbar since the progress callback will use self.epoch\n  aug_preds.append(learn.get_preds(dl=dl, inner=True)[0][None])\nSince I am to average these with the center-crop image predictions, I’ll create a new DataLoader without the CornerCrop transform and calculate the predictions on those images:\ndl = dls[1].new(shuffled=False, drop_last=False)\nwith dl.dataset.set_split_idx(1): preds,targs = learn.get_preds(dl=dl, inner=True)\nFinally, I’ll append the center crop preds to aug_preds list, concatenate them into a single tensor and take the mean of the predictions:\naug_preds.append(preds[None])\npreds = torch.cat(aug_preds).mean(0)\nI decided to create a new Learner2 class which extends the built-in the Learner, and added the corner_crop_tta method by copying over the tta method, commenting out the lines I won’t need and adding the lines and changes I’ve written above.\n\nclass Learner2(Learner):\n  def corner_crop_tta(self:Learner, ds_idx=1, dl=None, n=4, beta=0.25, use_max=False):\n      \"Return predictions on the `ds_idx` dataset or `dl` using Corner Crop Test Time Augmentation\"\n      if dl is None: dl = self.dls[ds_idx].new(shuffled=False, drop_last=False)\n      # if item_tfms is not None or batch_tfms is not None: dl = dl.new(after_item=item_tfms, after_batch=batch_tfms)\n      try:\n          #self(_before_epoch)\n          with dl.dataset.set_split_idx(0), self.no_mbar():\n              if hasattr(self,'progress'): self.progress.mbar = master_bar(list(range(n)))\n              aug_preds = []\n              # Crop image from four corners\n              for i in self.progress.mbar if hasattr(self,'progress') else range(n):\n                  dl = dl.new(after_item=[CornerCrop(224,i), ToTensor])\n                  self.epoch = i #To keep track of progress on mbar since the progress callback will use self.epoch\n                  aug_preds.append(self.get_preds(dl=dl, inner=True)[0][None])\n         # aug_preds = torch.cat(aug_preds)\n         # aug_preds = aug_preds.max(0)[0] if use_max else aug_preds.mean(0)\n          self.epoch = n\n          dl = self.dls[ds_idx].new(shuffled=False, drop_last=False)\n          # Crop image from center\n          with dl.dataset.set_split_idx(1): preds,targs = self.get_preds(dl=dl, inner=True)\n          aug_preds.append(preds[None])\n      finally: self(event.after_fit)\n\n     # if use_max: return torch.stack([preds, aug_preds], 0).max(0)[0],targs\n     # preds = (aug_preds,preds) if beta is None else torch.lerp(aug_preds, preds, beta)\n     # preds = torch.cat([aug_preds, preds]).mean(0)\n      preds = torch.cat(aug_preds).mean(0)\n      return preds,targs\n\n\n\nImplement this new TTA method on the Imagenette classification model\nIn the last section of this notebook, I train a model on the Imagenette dataset, which a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset.

On one hand, it provides a framework for the LLM to respond with and performs better than zero-shot prompting in the paper’s evaluation. On the other hand, for some of the models I tested, Zero-shot-CoT performed better than PS+ on a small set of 20 samples.\nThere are elements of the PS+ Prompting instruction that are also present in the system prompt that Jeremy recommended (emphasis mine):\n\nSince you are autoregressive, each token you produce is another opportunity to use computation, therefore you always spend a few sentences explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking BEFORE you try to answer a question. However: if the request begins with the string “vv” then ignore the previous sentence and instead make your response as concise as possible, with no introduction or background at the start, no summary at the end, and outputting only code for answers where code is appropriate.\nYour users are experts in AI and ethics, so they already know you’re a language model and your capabilities and limitations, so don’t remind them of that. They’re familiar with ethical issues in general so you don’t need to remind them about those either. Don’t be verbose in your answers, but do provide details and examples where it might help the explanation.

This model accurately classifies movie review as positive or negative.\n\nThat’s a wrap for this exercise. I hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

I am not confident in this model or approach as I did notice the training was unstable (highly varying accuracy across different trainings), and this dataset is not really meant for an NLP model. I also had a relatively smaller number of rows than the example that Jeremy showed. That being said, my model wasn’t a complete dud as it mostly accurately predicted who survived in my test set."

    "text": "What I’m Learning\nI’ll write in this blog post some examples of the translations and how I’m thinking through the process, as well as what I’m learning from discussions with my partner.\nThree main themes I’m seeing so far about translating from English to Spanish:\n\nwhich words to use depends a lot on context.\nwords that sound the same but mean different things will sometimes have different emphasis.\na word that is technically correct may not be used frequently in conversation.\n\nI’m not quite sure how to best document what I’m learning so I’ll just start writing.\n\nElla: “You haven’t written a word, have you?”\nSomething I enjoy doing is translating the Spanish back into English without changing word positions. The benefit of this exercise of translating and translating back is that it reveals (or focuses my attention on) nuances I wouldn’t otherwise be aware of.\nEnglish: You haven’t written a word, have you?\nSpanish: No has escrito una palabra verdad?\nBack to English: Not you have written a word true?\nI asked my partner how she would translate it and she said: No has escrito ni una palabra, verdad?\nWhich translates to: You haven’t written not even a word, true?\nIt bothers me that I don’t know why in English the question ends in have you? but in Spanish it ends with true?. Of course this may just be how Spanish works or how conversational Spanish works.\nI asked my partner how you would say just have you? in Spanish and it’s lo has?\nGoogle Translate aligns with this when it translates from Spanish to English:\nSpanish: No has escrito ni una palabra lo has?\nEnglish: You haven’t written a word, have you?\nBut recommends ending with verdad? when I translate from English to Spanish.\n\n\nSpeaker: “You can share mine”\nHere are the Google Translate forward and backward translations:\n\nEnglish: You can share mine.\nSpanish: Puedes compartir el mio.\n\nSpanish: Puedes compartir el mio.\nEnglish: Can you share mine.\n\nHowever, if I start the Spanish translation with tu the English translation matches my original prompt:\n\nSpanish: Tu puedes compartir el mio.\nEnglish: You can share mine.\n\nI think this is a good example of how what is technically correct may or may not be what’s used in conversation—saying tu may not be strictly required for conversation and may be implicitly understood because of the form used—puedes (you can).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\npuedes\nyou can\n\n\npuedo\nI can\n\n\npuedemos\nwe can\n\n\npueden\nthey can\n\n\n\n\n\nLestrade: “Well, they all took the same poison.”\nSomething else I’ve enjoyed and learned from is watching how a translation changes as you type the full sentence in Google Translate.\nFor example when translating from Spanish (pues, todos tomaron el mismo veneno) to English (well, they all took the same poison):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\npues\nwell\n\n\npues, todos\nwell, everyone\n\n\npues, todos tomaron\nwell, they all took\n\n\npues, todos tomaron el\nwell, everyone took\n\n\npues, todos tomaron el mismo\nwell, they all took the same\n\n\npues, todos tomaron el mismo veneno\nwell, they all took the same poison\n\n\n\nWhat I’m observing might have less to do with how Spanish works and more to do with how Google Translate works. Although some words seem interchangeable (todos seems to mean everyone or they all)."

Each child node has only one parent node pointing to it.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Fields\nContains attribute values associated with cells. Each cell in a field contains measurements or calculations from a continuous domain.\nsampling: how frequently to take the measurements (of continuous data).\ninterpolation: how to show values in between the sampled points in a way that does not mislead. Interpolating appropriately between the measurements allows you to reconstruct a new view of the data from an arbitrary viewpoint that’s faithful to what you measured.\ndiscrete: data where a finite number of individual items exist where interpolation between them is not a meaningful concept.\nTechnically all data stored within a computer is discrete rather than continuous; however, the interesting question is whether the underlying semantics of the bits that are stored represents samples of a continuous phenomenon or intrinsically discrete data.\n\n2.4.3.1 Spatial Fields\nCell structure of the field is based on sapling at spatial positions.\nA synonym for nonspatial data is abstract data.\nscientific visualization (scivis): concerned with situations where spatial position is given with the dataset.

A central concern of infovis is determining whether the chosen idiom is suitable for the combination of data and task, leading to the use of methods from human-computer interaction and design.\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Grid Types\nWhen a field contains data created by sampling at completely regular intervals, the calls form a uniform grid.\ngrid geometry: location in space.\ngrid topology: how each cell connects with its neighboring cells.\nrectilinear grid: supports nonuniform sampling, allowing efficient storage of information that has high complexity in some areas and low complexity in others, at the cost of storing some information about the geometric location of each row.\nstructured grid: allows curvilinear shapes, where the geometric location of each cell needs to be specified.\nunstructured grid: provides complete flexibility, but the topological information about how cells connect to each other must be stored explicitly in addition to their spatial positions.\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Geometry\nSpecifies information about the shape of items with explicit spatial positions. Geometry datasets do not necessarily have attributes.\nGeometric data is sometimes shown alone, particularly when shape understanding is the primary task. In other cases, it is the backdrop against which additional information is overlaid.\n\n\n2.4.5 Other Combinations\nset: unordered group of items.\nlist: a group of items with a specified ordering.\ncluster: a grouping based on attribute similarity.\npath: an ordered set of segments formed by links connecting nodes.\ncompound network: a network with an associated tree (all the nodes in the network are the leaves of the tree, and interior nodes in the tree provide a hierarchical structure for the nodes that is different from network links between them).\ndata abstraction: describing the what part of an analysis instance that pertains to data.\n\n\n2.4.6 Dataset Availability\nstatic file (offline): the entire dataset is available all at once.\ndynamic streams (online): the dataset information trickles in over the course of the vis session."

    "text": "3.2 Why Analyze Tasks Abstractly?\nTransforming task descriptions from domain-specific language into abstract form allows you to reason about similarities and differences between them.\nIf you don’t to this kind of translation then everything just appears to be different. The apparent difference is misleading: there are lots of similarities in what people want to do once you strip away the surface language differences.\nThe analysis framework has verbs describing actions and nouns describing targets.\nIt is often useful to consider only one of the user’s goals at a time, in order to more easily consider the question of how a particular idiom supports that goal. To describe complex activities, you can specify a chained sequence of tasks, where the output of one becomes the input to the next.\nTask abstraction can and should guide the data abstraction.\n\n3.3 Who: Designer or User\nOn the specific side, tools are narrow: the designer has built many choices into the design of the tool itself in a way that the user cannot override.\nOn the general side, tools are flexible and users have many choices to make.\nSpecialized vis tools are designed for specific contexts with a narrow range of data configurations, especially those created through a problem-driven process.\n\n\n3.4 Actions\nThree levels of actions that define user goals:\n\nhow the vis is being used to analyze (consume or produce data)\nwhat kind of search is involved (whether target and location are known)\nwhat kind query (identify one target, compare targets, or summarize all targets)\n\n\n3.4.1 Analyze\nTwo possible goals of people who want to analyze data: consume or actively produce new information.\n\nConsume information that has already been generated as data stored in a format amenable to computation\n\nDiscover something new\nPresent something that the user already understands\nEnjoy a vis to indulge their casual interests in a topic\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.1 Discover\nUsing a vis to find new knowledge that was not previously known, by the serendipitous observation of unexpected phenomena or motivated by existing theories, models, hypotheses or hunches.\ngenerate a new hypothesis: finding completely new things\nverify or disconfirm an existing hypothesis.\nThe discover goal is often discussed as the classic motivation for sophisticated interactive idioms, because the vis designer doesn’t know in advance what the user will need to see.\n(discover = explore, present = explain).\nWhy the vis is being used doesn’t dictate how the vis idiom is designed to achieve those goals.\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Present\nThe use of vis for the succinct communication of information, for telling a story with data, or guiding an audience through a series of cognitive operations.\nThe crucial point about the present goal is that vis is being used by somebody to communicate something specific and already understood to an audience. The knowledge communicated is already known to the presenter in advance. The output of a discover session becomes the input to a present session.\nThe decision about why is separable from how the idiom is designed: presentation can be supported through a wide variety of idiom design choices.\n\n\n3.4.1.3 Enjoy\nCasual encounters with vis.\nA vis tool may have been intended by the designer for the goal of discovery with a particular audience, but it might be used for pure enjoyment by a different group of people.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Produce\nThe intent of the user is to generate new material.\nThere are three kinds of produce goals:\n\nannotate\nrecord\nderive\n\n\n3.4.2.1 Annotate\nthe addition of graphical or textual annotations associated with one or more preexisting visualization elements, typically as a manual action by the user. Annotation for data items could be thought of as a new attribute for them.\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Record\nSaves or captures visualization elements as persistent artifacts (screenshots, lists of bookmarked elements or locations, parameter settings, interaction logs, or annotations). An annotation made by a user can subsequently be recorded.\n\n\n3.4.2.3 Derive\nProduce new data elements based on existing data elements. There is a strong relationship between the form of the data (the attribute and dataset types) and what kinds of vis idioms are effective at displaying it.\nDon’t just draw what you’re given; decide what the right thing to show is, create it with a series of transformations from the original dataset, and draw that.\nA synonym for derive is transform.\nderived attributes extend the dataset beyond the original set of attributes that it contains.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Search\nThe classification of search into four alternatives is broken down according to whether the identity and location of the search target is already known. The verb find is often used as a synonym in descriptions of search tasks, implying a successful outcome.\n\n3.4.3.1 Lookup\nUsers already know both what they’re looking for and where it is.\n\n\n3.4.3.2 Locate\nTo find a known target at an unknown location.\n\n\n3.4.3.3 Browse\nWhen users don’t know exactly what they’re looking for but they do have a location in mind of where to look for it.\n\n\n3.4.3.4 Explore\nWhen users don’t know what they’re looking for and are not even sure of the location.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Query\nOnce a target or set of targets for a search has been found, a low-level user goal is to query these targets at one of three scopes: identify (single target), compare (multiple targets) or summarize (all targets).\n\n3.4.4.1 Identify\nIf a search returns known targets either by lookup or locate then identify returns their characteristics.\nIf a search returns targets matching particular characteristics either by browse or explore, then identify returns specific references.\n\n\n3.4.4.2\nComparison tasks are typically more difficult than identify tasks and require more sophisticated idioms to support the user.\n\n\n3.4.4.3 Summarize\nA synonym for summarize is overview: to provide a comprehensive view of everything (verb) and a summary display of everything (noun)."

A block is the outcome of the design process at that level. Choosing the wrong block at an upstream level inevitable cascades to all downstream levels.\nVis design is usually a highly iterative refinement process, where a better understanding of the blocks at one level will feed back and forward into refining the blocks at the other levels.\n\n4.3.1 Domain Situation\ndomain situation: a group of target users, their domain interest, their questions, and their data.\ndomain: a particular field of interest of the target users of a vis tool.\nSituation blocks are identified.\nThe outcome of the design process is an understanding that the designer reaches about the needs of the user. The outcome of identifying a situation block is a detailed set of questions asked about or actions carried out by the target users, about a possible heterogeneous collection of data that’s also understood in detail.\nMethods include: interviews, observations, or careful research about target users within a specific domain.\nWorking closely with a specific target audience to iteratively refine a design is called user-centered design or human-centered design.\nWhat users say they do when reflecting on their past behavior gives you an incomplete picture compared with what they actually do if you observe them.\n\n\n4.3.2 Task and Data Abstraction\nAbstracting into the domain-independent vocabulary allows you to realize how domain situation blocks that are described using very different language might have similar reasons why the user needs the vis tool and what data it shows.\nTask blocks are identified by the designer as being suitable for a particular domain situation block, just as the situation blocks themselves are identified at the level above.\nAbstract data blocks are designed.\nThe data abstraction level requires you to consider whether and how the same dataset provided by a user should be transformed into another form.\nYour goal is to determine which data type would support a visual representation of it that addresses the user’s problem.\nExplicitly considering the choices made in abstracting from domain-specific to generic tasks and data can be very useful in the vis design process.\n\n\n4.3.3 Visual Encoding and Interaction Idiom\nidiom: a distinct way to create and manipulate the visual representation of the abstract data block that you chose at the previous level, guided by the abstract tasks that you also identified at that level.\nthe visual encoding idiom controls exactly what users see.\nthe interaction idiom controls how users change what they see.\nIdiom blocks are designed.\nThe nested model emphasizes identifying task abstractions and deciding on data abstractions in the previous level exactly so that you can use them to rule out many of the options as being a bad match for the goals of the users. You should make decisions about good and bad matches based on understanding human abilities, especially in terms of visual perception and memory.\n\n\n4.3.4 Algorithm\nalgorithm: a detailed procedure that allows a computer to automatically carry out the desired goal.\nAlgorithm blocks are designed."

Field studies for domain situation assessment often involve gathering qualitative data through semi-structured interviews.\nOne downstream form of validation is adoption rates of the vis tool.\n\n\n4.6.2 Abstraction Validation\nThe threat at this level is that the identified task abstraction blocks and designed data abstraction blocks do not solve the characterized problems of the target audience. The key aspect of validation against this threat is that the system must be tested by target users doing their own work, rather than doing an abstract task specified by the designers of the vis system.\n\n\n4.6.3 Idiom Validation\nThe threat at this level is that the chosen idioms are not effective at communicating the desired abstraction to the person using the system. One immediate validation approach is to carefully justify the design of the idiom with respect to known perceptual and cognitive principles.\nA downstream approach to validate against this threat is to carry out a lab study: a controlled experiment in a laboratory setting.\n\n\n4.6.4 Algorithm Validation\nThe primary threat at this level is that the algorithm is suboptimal in terms of time or memory performance, either to a theoretical minimum or in comparison with previously proposed algorithms.\nAn immediate form of validation is to analyze the computational complexity of the algorithm, using the standard approaches from the computer science literature.\nThe downstream form of validation is to measures the wall-clock time and memory performance of the implemented algorithm.\n\n\n4.6.5 Mismatches\nA common problem in weak vis projects is a mismatch between the level at which the benefit is claimed (for example, visual encoding idiom) and the validation methodologies chosen (for example, wall-clock timings of the algorithm)."

Adding the visual channel of size encodes a fourth quantitative attribute as well.\nHigher-dimensional mark types usually have built-in constraints (on size and shape) that arise from the way that they are defined.

    "text": "Background and Goals\nIt’s been 5 years since I last explored NFL’s play-by-play data. It’s also been 5 years since my Eagles won the Super Bowl, which will be played in less than 24 hours from now. Go Birds.\nIt’s been so long since I’ve blogged that fastpages, the blogging library I use, has been deprecated.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed some of the statistical analyses put forth by fans of the NFL this year. My favorite analyst is Deniz Selman, a fellow Eagles fan who makes these beautiful data presentations.\nI also appreciate Deniz’ critique of analysis-without-context that often negates the brilliance of Jalen Hurts:\n\n\nAs I’ve been trying to say all year, EPA/dropback is not nearly as valuable a metric when the offense lets the QB decide whether it’s a “dropback” or not during the play by reading the defense, and that QB is the absolute best at making that decision. #FlyEaglesFly\n\n— Deniz Selman (@denizselman33) February 11, 2023\n\n\nMy second favorite analyst is Ben Baldwin, AKA Computer Cowboy especially his 4th down analysis realtime during games.\nThere has been an onslaught of statistical advances in the NFL since I last explored play-by-play data and I’m excited to learn as much as I can. In particular, I’d like to get a hang of the metrics EPA (Expected Points Added) and DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average), which may not necessarily intersect with my play-by-play analysis (I believe Football Outsiders is the proprietor of that formula).\nI’d also like to use this project to practice more advanced SQL queries than I’m used to. Given the complexity of the play-by-play dataset (by team, down, field position, etc.) I’m hoping I can get those reps in.\nLastly, I’d like to explore data presentation with these statistics using R, python, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I’ve been inspired by simple, elegant graphics like those made by Peter Gorman in Barely Maps and bold, picturesque statistics posted by PFF on twitter:\n\n\nThe most clutch pass rushers face off in the Super Bowl pic.twitter.com/o50lV9Bkgk\n\n— PFF (@PFF) February 12, 2023\n\n\nI’ll work on this project in this post throughout this year–and maybe beyond if it fuels me with enough material–or it’ll fork off into something entirely new or different.\nI’ll start off by next exploring the schema of the play-by-play dataset."

I’ll see if removing out-of-domain features improves the error.\n\n\nOut-of-Domain Features\nI’ll remove columns from the training set that are out-of-domain (i.e., significantly different in values from) in the validation set. I’ll identify these columns by fitting a random forest to predict whether a row is in the training or validation set and then observing the most important features in this prediction:\n\ndf_dom = pd.concat([xs_final, valid_xs_final])\nis_valid = np.array([0]*len(xs_final) + [1]*len(valid_xs_final))\n\nm = rf(df_dom, is_valid)\nrf_feat_importance(m, df_dom)[:6]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncols\nimp\n\n\n\n\n7\nsaledate\n0.704401\n\n\n15\nsaleYear\n0.215157\n\n\n10\nSalesID\n0.075075\n\n\n13\nMachineID\n0.003997\n\n\n0\nYearMade\n0.000683\n\n\n4\nModelID\n0.000228\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThe most important feature in predicting whether a row is in the training or validation set is the saledate feature. This makes sense because I explicitly define the training and validation sets based on saledate. The next two features of high importance are saleYear and SalesID which also are related to when the sale occured.\n\n# baseline\nm = rf(xs_final, y)\nprint('orig', m_rmse(m, valid_xs_final, valid_y))\n\nfor c in ('saledate', 'saleYear', 'SalesID'):\n  m = rf(xs_final.drop(c, axis=1), y)\n  print(c, m_rmse(m, valid_xs_final.drop(c,axis=1), valid_y))\n\norig 0.365206\nsaledate 0.246061\nsaleYear 0.437766\nSalesID 0.402223\n\n\nRemoving saledate reduces the error by a third!\n\nxs_final_time = xs_final.drop('saledate', axis=1)\nvalid_xs_time = valid_xs_final.drop('saledate', axis=1)\n\nm = rf(xs_final_time, y)\nm_rmse(m, valid_xs_time, valid_y)\n\n\nm_rmse(m, xs_final_time, y), m_rmse(m, valid_xs_time, valid_y)\n\n(0.189063, 0.247074)\n\n\n\nlen(xs_final_time.columns)\n\n18\n\n\nThe validation error is still larger than the training error but removing saledate has reduced the validation error considerably, even when compared to the original dataset and the dataset after only low-importance features were removed. I consider this process of feature removal successful."

The output is a matrix with one row for each training observation, and 5 columns (chosen by the model for ProductSize):\n\nemb_data = emb(tensor(xs_final_time['ProductSize'], dtype=torch.int64))\nemb_data.shape\n\ntorch.Size([395371, 5])\n\n\n\nlen(xs_final_time)\n\n395371\n\n\nTo appropriately name the columns in the updated dataset, I label the embedding layer names as done in the medium post:\n\nemb_names = [f'ProductSize_{j}' for j in range(emb_data.shape[1])]\nemb_names\n\n['ProductSize_0',\n 'ProductSize_1',\n 'ProductSize_2',\n 'ProductSize_3',\n 'ProductSize_4']\n\n\nI then convert the 2-D tensor to a DataFrame:\n\nfeat_df = pd.DataFrame(\n    data=emb_data,\n    index=xs_final_time.index,\n    columns=emb_names)\n\nfeat_df.head()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductSize_0\nProductSize_1\nProductSize_2\nProductSize_3\nProductSize_4\n\n\n\n\n0\n-0.003886\n0.204614\n-0.099826\n0.152207\n0.215685\n\n\n1\n-0.114329\n-0.100198\n-0.071906\n-0.128801\n-0.039516\n\n\n2\n-0.003886\n0.204614\n-0.099826\n0.152207\n0.215685\n\n\n3\n-0.005051\n0.042276\n-0.102471\n0.016768\n0.001030\n\n\n4\n-0.003886\n0.204614\n-0.099826\n0.152207\n0.215685\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFinally, I drop the ProductSize column from the dataset and replace it with my embedding DataFrame:\n\nxs_temp = xs_final_time.drop('ProductSize', axis=1)\nxs_temp = xs_temp.join(feat_df)\nxs_temp.columns\n\nIndex(['YearMade', 'Coupler_System', 'fiProductClassDesc', 'ModelID',\n       'Grouser_Tracks', 'fiSecondaryDesc', 'fiModelDesc', 'ProductGroup',\n       'SalesID', 'Enclosure', 'fiModelDescriptor', 'MachineID', 'Hydraulics',\n       'saleYear', 'Drive_System', 'Tire_Size', 'Pad_Type', 'ProductSize_0',\n       'ProductSize_1', 'ProductSize_2', 'ProductSize_3', 'ProductSize_4'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nWith a single iteration done successfully, now I can run the whole loop and get the updated dataset with embedding matrices:\n\ndef embed_features(learn, xs):\n  xs = xs.copy()\n\n  for i, col in enumerate(learn.dls.cat_names):\n    emb = learn.model.embeds[i]\n    emb_data = emb(tensor(xs[col], dtype=torch.int64))\n    emb_names = [f'{col}_{j}' for j in range(emb_data.shape[1])]\n\n    feat_df = pd.DataFrame(\n        data=emb_data,\n        index=xs.index,\n        columns=emb_names\n    )\n\n    xs = xs.drop(col, axis=1)\n    xs = xs.join(feat_df)\n  return xs\n\nOne bit of preprocessing I’ll have to do is swap the categorical columns in xs_final_time with the ones in to_nn.train.xs since the latter has been “categorified” by the Categorify fastai processor into 0 to n integer values. To illustrate: the first value of the YearMade column in xs_final_time is 2004 whereas it’s converted to the integer 63 in the corresponding to_nn.train.xs column. The embedding corresponding to this column has a dimension of 72 so it can take a maximum value of 71 as the input, which is the maximum value in to_nn.train.xs['YearMade'].\n\nxs_final_time['YearMade'][0]\n\n2004\n\n\n\nto_nn.train.xs['YearMade'][0]\n\n63\n\n\n\nlearn.model.embeds[0]\n\nEmbedding(72, 18)\n\n\n\nto_nn.train.xs['YearMade'].max()\n\n71\n\n\nHere’s a bit of code to swap the columns:\n\ndef prep_xs(to_nn, xs):\n  xs = xs.copy()\n  for col in to_nn.train.xs.columns:\n    xs[col] = to_nn[col]\n  return xs\n\n\nxs_with_embs = prep_xs(to_nn, xs_final_time)\nxs_with_embs['YearMade'].unique()\n\narray([63, 55, 60, 66, 52, 67,  1, 57, 58, 62, 50, 59, 64, 54, 65, 61, 43,\n       47, 39, 51, 46, 56, 30, 37, 48, 44, 38, 35, 53, 41, 49, 33, 27, 25,\n       42, 45, 40, 29, 36, 34, 32, 24, 26, 68, 69, 28, 31, 23, 16, 17, 22,\n        2,  3,  9,  7, 11,  5, 15, 13, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 10,  4,  8,\n        6, 71, 70], dtype=int8)\n\n\nNow that I have categorified the categorical columns the embeddings are trained on, I can process to swap them with embedding matrices:\n\nxs_with_embs = embed_features(learn, xs_with_embs)\nxs_with_embs.columns\n\nIndex(['ModelID', 'SalesID', 'MachineID', 'saleYear', 'YearMade_0',\n       'YearMade_1', 'YearMade_2', 'YearMade_3', 'YearMade_4', 'YearMade_5',\n       ...\n       'Tire_Size_2', 'Tire_Size_3', 'Tire_Size_4', 'Tire_Size_5',\n       'Tire_Size_6', 'Tire_Size_7', 'Pad_Type_0', 'Pad_Type_1', 'Pad_Type_2',\n       'Pad_Type_3'],\n      dtype='object', length=329)\n\n\nI’ll check to see that the number of columns corresponding to the embedding matches the number of columns in the second dimension of the embedding matrix:\n\nlearn.model.embeds[0]\n\nEmbedding(72, 18)\n\n\n\n' '.join(o for o in xs_with_embs.columns if o.startswith('YearMade'))\n\n'YearMade_0 YearMade_1 YearMade_2 YearMade_3 YearMade_4 YearMade_5 YearMade_6 YearMade_7 YearMade_8 YearMade_9 YearMade_10 YearMade_11 YearMade_12 YearMade_13 YearMade_14 YearMade_15 YearMade_16 YearMade_17'\n\n\n\nlearn.model.embeds[1]\n\nEmbedding(7, 5)\n\n\n\n' '.join(o for o in xs_with_embs.columns if o.startswith('ProductSize'))\n\n'ProductSize_0 ProductSize_1 ProductSize_2 ProductSize_3 ProductSize_4'\n\n\nI’ll make the same changes to the validation set:\n\nvalid_xs_with_embs = prep_xs(to_nn, valid_xs_time)\nvalid_xs_with_embs['YearMade'].unique()\n\narray([ 1, 63, 61, 66, 68, 64, 60, 57, 58, 65, 67, 59, 48, 62, 56, 40, 44,\n       49, 55, 34, 35, 39, 54, 42, 41, 23, 45, 38, 43, 52, 47, 51, 53, 50,\n       33, 37, 36, 46, 27, 30, 28, 32, 25, 31, 24, 15, 22, 29, 21, 26,  0,\n       70, 69, 17, 16, 12], dtype=int8)\n\n\n\nvalid_xs_with_embs = embed_features(learn, valid_xs_with_embs)\nvalid_xs_with_embs.columns\n\nIndex(['ModelID', 'SalesID', 'MachineID', 'saleYear', 'YearMade_0',\n       'YearMade_1', 'YearMade_2', 'YearMade_3', 'YearMade_4', 'YearMade_5',\n       ...\n       'Tire_Size_2', 'Tire_Size_3', 'Tire_Size_4', 'Tire_Size_5',\n       'Tire_Size_6', 'Tire_Size_7', 'Pad_Type_0', 'Pad_Type_1', 'Pad_Type_2',\n       'Pad_Type_3'],\n      dtype='object', length=329)\n\n\n\n' '.join(o for o in valid_xs_with_embs.columns if o.startswith('YearMade'))\n\n'YearMade_0 YearMade_1 YearMade_2 YearMade_3 YearMade_4 YearMade_5 YearMade_6 YearMade_7 YearMade_8 YearMade_9 YearMade_10 YearMade_11 YearMade_12 YearMade_13 YearMade_14 YearMade_15 YearMade_16 YearMade_17'\n\n\n\n' '.join(o for o in valid_xs_with_embs.columns if o.startswith('ProductSize'))\n\n'ProductSize_0 ProductSize_1 ProductSize_2 ProductSize_3 ProductSize_4'\n\n\nLooks good!

Currently my training dataset has 300+ columns in it.\n\nxs_with_embs.shape\n\n(395371, 329)\n\n\n\nLow-Importance Features\nHere are the top-10 features in my model—all except one of the top 10 features are outputs from the categorical embeddings.\n\nfi = rf_feat_importance(m, xs_with_embs)\nfi[:10]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncols\nimp\n\n\n\n\n37\nfiProductClassDesc_7\n0.117214\n\n\n263\nfiModelDesc_183\n0.099233\n\n\n3\nsaleYear\n0.063399\n\n\n36\nfiProductClassDesc_6\n0.062105\n\n\n209\nfiModelDesc_129\n0.050837\n\n\n208\nfiModelDesc_128\n0.037791\n\n\n43\nfiProductClassDesc_13\n0.033951\n\n\n181\nfiModelDesc_101\n0.027102\n\n\n152\nfiModelDesc_72\n0.017599\n\n\n100\nfiModelDesc_20\n0.017077\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nAnd here’s a plot of the top 30 most important features:\n\ndef plot_fi(fi):\n  return fi.plot('cols', 'imp', 'barh', figsize=(12,7), legend=False)\n\nplot_fi(fi[:30]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike last time, I’ll only keep features that have an importance of 0.005 or greater—which results in keeping only about 10% of the columns:\n\nto_keep = fi[fi.imp&gt;0.005].cols\nlen(to_keep)\n\n36\n\n\n\nxs_imp_embs = xs_with_embs[to_keep]\nvalid_xs_imp_embs = valid_xs_with_embs[to_keep]\n\n\nxs_imp_embs.shape, valid_xs_imp_embs.shape\n\n((395371, 36), (17327, 36))\n\n\n\nm = rf(xs_imp_embs, y);\nm_rmse(m, xs_imp_embs, y), m_rmse(m, valid_xs_imp_embs, valid_y)\n\n(0.184552, 0.242728)\n\n\nThe errors are higher than when all columns were included, but lower than when the original categorical columns were included.\n\n\nRedundant Features\nSimilar to before, I’ll see if I can remove any redundant features from the dataset to continue simplifying the model.\n\ncluster_columns(xs_imp_embs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was expecting more columns to be redundant, since the columns in a categorical embedding matrix are related to the same column. However, it’s interesting to note that different embedding matrix columns for a categorical variable represent different aspects of that feature.\nAs before, I’ll calculate a baseline OOB score, and then use it to compare with scores after redundant features are removed:\n\nget_oob(xs_imp_embs)\n\n0.8892042378420308\n\n\nHere are the OOB scores if I drop each individual redundant feature from the dataset:\n\n{c: get_oob(xs_imp_embs.drop(c, axis=1)) for c in (\n    'ProductSize_1', 'ProductSize_4',\n    'YearMade_8', 'YearMade_5',\n    'ProductGroup_4', 'ProductGroup_3')}\n\n{'ProductSize_1': 0.8885392743641873,\n 'ProductSize_4': 0.8890680891755572,\n 'YearMade_8': 0.8885895030231491,\n 'YearMade_5': 0.8884153739148248,\n 'ProductGroup_4': 0.8890909768453596,\n 'ProductGroup_3': 0.8890208894539288}\n\n\nI’ll remove the three columns, the removal of which keeps the first three decimal places of the OOB score the same.\n\nto_drop = ['ProductSize_4', 'ProductGroup_4', 'ProductGroup_3']\nget_oob(xs_imp_embs.drop(to_drop, axis=1))\n\n0.8890859448391993\n\n\n\nxs_embs_final = xs_imp_embs.drop(to_drop, axis=1)\nvalid_xs_embs_final = valid_xs_imp_embs.drop(to_drop, axis=1)\n\n\nm = rf(xs_embs_final, y)\nm_rmse(m, xs_embs_final, y), m_rmse(m, valid_xs_embs_final, valid_y)\n\n(0.184845, 0.244098)\n\n\nThe errors have slightly increased but are still lower than the model fitted to the original dataset.\n\n\nOut-of-Domain Features\nThe final set of features I’ll look to remove are those that have significantly different values between the training and validation sets. As I did before, I’ll fit a random forest to predict whether a row is from the training or validation set, and then look at the most important features for this distinction:\n\ndf_dom = pd.concat([xs_embs_final, valid_xs_embs_final])\nis_valid = np.array([0]*len(xs_embs_final) + [1]*len(valid_xs_embs_final))\n\nm = rf(df_dom, is_valid)\nrf_feat_importance(m, df_dom)[:6]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncols\nimp\n\n\n\n\n2\nsaleYear\n0.567392\n\n\n12\nSalesID\n0.266997\n\n\n22\nMachineID\n0.072159\n\n\n26\nYearMade_12\n0.006785\n\n\n15\nYearMade_5\n0.004990\n\n\n24\nYearMade_8\n0.004247\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThe three most important features in distinguishing a training set row from a validation set row are saleYear, SalesID, and MachineID. This is similar to what we experienced before—these are all time-influenced features and the training and validation set is split based on the sale date. I’ll remove each one and see if it decreases the error of the model:\n\n# baseline\nm = rf(xs_embs_final, y)\nprint('orig', m_rmse(m, valid_xs_embs_final, valid_y))\n\nfor c in ('saleYear', 'SalesID', 'MachineID'):\n  m = rf(xs_embs_final.drop(c, axis=1), y)\n  print(c, m_rmse(m, valid_xs_embs_final.drop(c,axis=1), valid_y))\n\norig 0.243168\nsaleYear 0.248063\nSalesID 0.243861\nMachineID 0.243165\n\n\nIt looks like I can remove MachineID with only a tiny increase in the error.\n\ntime_vars = ['MachineID']\nxs_embs_final_time = xs_embs_final.drop(time_vars, axis=1)\nvalid_xs_embs_time = valid_xs_embs_final.drop(time_vars, axis=1)\n\nm = rf(xs_embs_final_time, y)\n\n\nm_rmse(m, xs_embs_final_time, y), m_rmse(m, valid_xs_embs_time, valid_y)\n\n(0.189369, 0.243094)\n\n\n\n# save for later\nembs_xs = xs_embs_final_time, valid_xs_embs_time\nsave_pickle('embs_xs.pkl', embs_xs)\n\nAfter removing features, the errors on the training and validation sets are a tiny bit smaller than the errors on the original datasets."

I’m not sure what explains this small reduction. Maybe there’s something about this dataset that doesn’t benefit from converting categorical variables to embeddings? There’s always a chance that my implementation is incorrect, or not the best way to achieve benefits in the model. As I practice working with more tabular datasets, I’ll continue to implement neural net embeddings and observe if it makes a difference in how the model performs.\nI hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition. I’m excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\nIn this blog post series, I’ll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way. My last two blog posts in this series reference Jeremy’s Scaling Up: Road to the Top, Part 3 notebook to improve my large model ensemble predictions.

Most of the time on Colab or Kaggle you are not going to get one of those more up to date GPUs. Having said that, there’s really never any harm using half-precision floating point. Even if you are using an older GPU, it’s still going to save memory.

    "section": "Discussion of fit_one_cycle",
    "text": "Discussion of fit_one_cycle\nfit_one_cycle uses a scheduler which is something that changes the learning rate during training. Remember that the learning rate is the thing we multiply the gradients by before we subtract them from the parameters. When you have a randomly initialized model, or even a pretrained model (we randomly initialize the last layer of weights). At first even a pretrained model that we are fine-tuning can’t do anything. It’s still giving random answers. That means we want to use a really small learning rate because it’s very difficult to get to a point where it’s starting to learn something slightly useful. So with fit_one_cycle when we start training the first few batches use a tiny learning rate, and then as the model gets better and better at doing something useful, you can increase the learning rate because it’s gotten to a point where it knows vaguely what it’s doing. So as it trains the learning rate goes up, and then as you start to get close to the answer, you need to decrease the learning rate because you only need to take really little steps. The schedule used by fit_one_cycle is not interacting with anything (training loss, validation loss, etc) it’s just following the shape of the curve of learning rate vs. batch number.\nSylvain Gugger has a good blog post about the 1cycle policy.\nThe learning rate finder (Learner.lr_find) does something very similar to the 1cycle scheduler, which is that it gradually increases the learning rate while it train up to 100 batches, which is generally far less than an epoch. It doesn’t increase then decrease the learning rate like fit_one_cycle, it just increases it until the whole training falls apart. Once the learning gets too high, the model jumps past the answer and the loss shoots off exponentially.\nIt surprisingly difficult to come up with algorithmically what our eyes do when we look at the loss curve to pick the best learning rate. Zach Mueller did a lot of experimenting with learning rate finder on the suggested learning rate defaults (minimum, steep, valley, slide). Note: “minimum” is the actual minimum divided by 10.\nMost of the time fastai’s default learning rate works fine. Particularly for a tabular dataset the learning rate can be almost anything. It really does depend on the model. If you try something and it doesn’t seem to be training well, run lr_rind just in case the default learning rate is nowhere near the recommended values."

Once everything is working well, try it on a couple of models or at least run it on a bigger one.\nIf it was like a segmentation problem or an object detection problem, medical imaging dataset which has pictures that aren’t in ImageNet, Jeremy would try more different architectures, but in those cases he would not try to replicate the research of others and would look at paperswithcode.com to find out which techniques have the best results on segmentation and better still would go and find 2-3 previous Kaggle competitions that have a similar problem type and see who won and see what they did. They’ll likely have done an ensemble, which is fine, but they will also say “the best model in the ensemble was X”, and so just use the smallest version of X I can get away with.\nGenerally fiddling with architectures tends not to be very useful for any kind of problem that people have fairly regularly studied.\nIn my next blog post I walk through the discussion and code from Live Coding 10."

    "text": "The best models for fine tuning image recognition\nAll deep learning models will return a set of probabilities. That’s what their final layer returns and we decode them using argmax across them. There’s nothing to stop you from using those probabilities directly.\nThe Paddy Classification competition are kind of like the natural images you see in ImageNet, but ImageNet doesn’t have any categories about diseases, they have categories about what’s the main object in this image, such as different types of grass or fields or something. It’s a bit different to ImageNet, which is what most of our pretrained models are trained on. Nearly all of the images are the same shape and size in this competition.\nThere are two key dimensions that really seem to impact how well a model can be fine-tuned: - How similar is your dataset to the dataset used for the pretrained model? - If it’s similar (like PETS to ImageNet), then the critical factor is how well does the fine-tuning of the model maintain the weights that are pretrained. They’re probably not going to change very much. And you can take advantage of really big accurate models that have learned to do almost the exact same thing that you are trying to do. - If it’s not similar (like Planets to ImageNet), a lot of the weights of a pretrained model are going to be useless for fine-tuning this because they’e learned specific features (like what does text look like, what do eyeballs look like, what does fur look like) none of which are going to be useful at all. - How big is your dataset? - On a big dataset, you’ve got time and epochs to take advantage of having lots of parameters in the model to learn to use them effectively. If you don’t have much data you don’t have much ability to do that.\nJeremy and Thomas Capelle analyze which models are the best for fine-tuning and Jeremy published the results in this notebook. They used YAML files for Weights and Biases to define the different models and parameters that they wanted to test. You can use the wandb web GUI to view the training results. This gist has the results.\nYou can export a pandas.DataFrame to a StringIO() object which essentially stores the data as a string.\nfrom io import StringIO\nstrm = StringIO()\ndf.to_csv(strm, index=False)\ntxt = strm.getvalue()\nYou can also create a gist programatically:\nimport ghapi.core as gh\ng = gh.GhApi()\ngist = g.create_gist('name', txt, filename='name.csv', public=True)\n\n# view URL\ngist.html_url\nThe vit family of models is particularly good at rapidly identifying features of data types it hasn’t seen before (like medical imaging or satellite imagery). They also have good error rate with low memory usage. The swin family, also a transformers-based model like vit, was the most accurate for fine-tuning the Planets dataset. For the Planets dataset, the really big slow models don’t necessarily have better error rates. Which makes sense because if they have heaps of parameters but they’re trying to learn something they’ve never seen before it’s unlikely that we will be able to take advantage of those parameters.\nFor some models (like vit_small_patch16_224) you can only use 224x224 image sizes, while with others (like convnext_tiny) you can use any sized images.\nJeremy ran the vision model fine-tuning on 3 RTX GPUs for about 12 hours. They didn’t try all combinations of all parameters. Thomas ran a learning rate sweep to get a sense of what learning rates work well, and then they tried a couple of learning rates, a couple of the best resize methods and a couple of the best pooling types across a few broadly different kinds of models across the two different datasets. In every single case, the same learning rate, resize method and pooling method was the best."

In this section, he used the following training function, which I’ll use here for these small models, to prepare my submission predictions.

The list returned by learn.tta has a second item of None, which represents the targets (which we don’t have in the test set) we need to pick out just the first item (the predictions).\nzipping the items in tta_res creates a list of two tuples: a tuple with the three sets of predictions (the first item in each element of tta_res) and a tuple with three Nones (the second item of each element of tta_res).\nHere’s a toy example to illustrate:\n\nlist(zip(*[[(1), None],[(2), None]]))\n\n[(1, 2), (None, None)]\n\n\nThe first function rerurns the first element of an iterable object.\n\nfirst??\n\n\nSignature: first(x, f=None, negate=False, **kwargs)\nSource:   \ndef first(x, f=None, negate=False, **kwargs):\n    \"First element of `x`, optionally filtered by `f`, or None if missing\"\n    x = iter(x)\n    if f: x = filter_ex(x, f=f, negate=negate, gen=True, **kwargs)\n    return next(x, None)\nFile:      /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastcore/basics.py\nType:      function\n\n\n\n\nfirst(list(zip(*[[(1), None],[(2), None]])))\n\n(1, 2)\n\n\nThe second element of the zipped tta_res list is a tuple of Nones.\n\nlist(zip(*tta_res))[1]\n\n(None, None, None)\n\n\nI’ll now apply this code to tta_res:\n\ntta_prs = first(zip(*tta_res))\n\n\nlen(tta_prs[0])\n\n3469\n\n\nNext, in order to take the mean value of the predictions, we stack them into a tensor:\n\nt_tta = torch.stack(tta_prs)\n\n\nt_tta.shape\n\ntorch.Size([3, 3469, 10])\n\n\nThen, we take the mean of the three predictions for each of the 10 classes for each image.\n\navg_pr = t_tta.mean(0)\n\n\navg_pr.shape\n\ntorch.Size([3469, 10])\n\n\nWe then get the index of the largest probability out of the 10 classes for each image, which is the “prediction” that the model has made for the image.\n\nidxs = avg_pr.argmax(dim=1)\nidxs.shape\n\ntorch.Size([3469])\n\n\n\nidxs\n\ntensor([7, 8, 3,  ..., 8, 1, 5])\n\n\nFinally, we convert those indexes to strings of disease names using the vocab and prepare the submission file:\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(trn_path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224))\nmapping = dict(enumerate(dls.vocab))\nss = pd.read_csv(path/'sample_submission.csv')\nresults = pd.Series(idxs.numpy(), name='idxs').map(mapping)\nss.label = results\nss.to_csv('ensemble_subm.csv', index=False)\n\n\n!head ensemble_subm.csv\n\nimage_id,label\n200001.jpg,hispa\n200002.jpg,normal\n200003.jpg,blast\n200004.jpg,blast\n200005.jpg,blast\n200006.jpg,brown_spot\n200007.jpg,dead_heart\n200008.jpg,brown_spot\n200009.jpg,hispa"

    "text": "Gradient accumulation to prevent out of memory\nIf you run out of memory while training any of these large models, you can use GradientAccumulation to lower the memory usage. In the training loop we get the gradients, we add the gradients times the learning rate to the weights, and then we zero the gradients. What you could do is halve the batch size, so for example from 64 to 32, and then only zero the gradients every two iterations, and only do the update every two iterations. So you calculate in two batches what you calculate in one batch and it will be mathematically identical, That’s called GradientAccumulation, which added to the Learner as a callback, which are things that change the behavior of the training.\nHow batches work: we randomly shuffle the dataset, and grab the next batch size of images, we resize them all to be the same size, and we stack them on top of each other. If it’s black and white images for example, we would have 64 (or whatever the batch size is) 640 x 480 (or whatever image size you want) images so we end up with a 64 x 640 x 480 tensor. Pretty much all of the functionality provided by PyTorch will work fine for a mini batch of things just as it would for a single thing.\nInference is often done on CPU instead of GPU since you only need to process one thing at a time. Or people will queue a few of them up and stick them on a GPU.\nIn my next blog post I walk through the discussion and code from Live Coding 11."

Jeremy turns his model training routine into a python script, taking in arguments and passing them to a training function which initializes wandb using the given configuration, fine-tunes it, and does logging. NVIDIA tells you the GPU power usage (among other metrics). The key thing is the maximum memory use (wandb.summary[\"GPU_mem\"]).\nfastai has a thing called fastgpu which is a “queue service for quickly developing scripts that use all of your GPUs efficiently.” wandb takes this much further.\nNote: The information about your git repo is in .git/config.\nwandb API gives access to the runs logs (list of dictionaries) that we can then chuck into a DataFrame.\nNote: plotly has interactive parallel coordinates plot."

    "section": "Brute force hyperparameter optimisation vs human approach",
    "text": "Brute force hyperparameter optimisation vs human approach\nIn general, Jeremy doesn’t do Bayesian hyperparameter stuff ever. Which is funny because he taught wandb about the method they use for hyperparameter optimization. Used it once specifically for finding a good set of dropouts for AWD_LSTM—coded a random forest that actually tries to predict how accurate something’s going to be and then use that random forest to target better sets of hyperparameters. Jeremy likes to use a much more human-driven approach—what’s the hypothesis I’m trying to test, how can I test that as fast as possible. Most hyperparameters are independent of other hyperparameters. You don’t have to do a huge grid search. For example learning rate of 0.008 is always the best so let’s not try every learning rate for every model for every resize type, etc., let’s just use that learning rate. Same thing for resize method—crop was always better than squish for the few things we tried it on so we don’t have to try every combination. Jeremy also feels that he learns a lot more about deep learning when he asks like what do I want to know about this thing? Or is that thing independent of that other thing? Or are they connected or not? Next time I do another project I can leverage the knowledge of what I’ve learnt rather than do yet another huge hyperparameter sweep. My brain is the thing that’s learning. People at big companies that spend all of their time doing this big hyperparameter optimizations I always feel in talking to them they don’t seem to know much about the practice of deep learning. Like they don’t seem to know like what generally works and what generally doesn’t work because they never bother trying to figure out the answers to those questions, but instead they just chuck in a huge hyperparameter optimization thing into a thousand GPUs.\nHyperparameters generalize across different architectures and models (see this study). Across 90 different models they all had basically the same best learning rate (or close enough). This is true of computer vision, but not necessarily for tabular. All computer vision problems do all look pretty similar, the data for them looks pretty similar, Jeremy suspects that’s also true of object recognition. Nobody seems to be testing this but we should do similar tests for segmentation, bounding boxes, and so forth. Jeremy’s pretty sure we’d find the same thing."

    "text": "Strategy for iterating between notebooks\nWhen Jeremy iterates through notebooks, what he tends to do is that once he’s got something vaguely working, he generally duplicates it and then tries to get something else vaguely working (change a parameter, try a different method, etc.), and once that starts vaguely working, he renames it. Then, from time to time, he cleans up the duplicated notebook versions that he didn’t end up using and he can tell which ones those are because he hasn’t renamed them yet (paddy_base_Copy1.ipynb, paddy_base_Copy2.ipynb, etc.).\nIn this case, Jeremy started out with paddy.ipynb, and just experimented (show_batch, lr_find and try to get something running). From that he dupicated it (paddy_Copy1.ipynb). In that he wanted to try different architectures, batch transforms and item transforms so he created a train function which takes those three things, creates a set of ImageDataLoaders with those transforms, use a fixed seed to get the same validation set each time (to compare performance across architectures), train it with an architecture, and then return the tta error rate. He then goes through the notebook trying different small architectures (small so they will run decently quickly), batch and item transforms. From that he gets a sense of which batch and item transforms work well for which architectures. He renames this notebookpaddy-small.ipynb.\nJeremy is looking at two things: error rate at the end of training and tta error rate. The main one he cares about is the tta error rate since that’s the one he’s going to end up using.\nIf you pass an int instead of a tuple to item or batch transforms’ size parameter it will resize to a square.\nMost frameworks (at the time of this video) doesn’t provide a test time augmentation method (except for one unnamed group that copies everything from fastai).\nThe cool kids on Kaggle (at the time of this videoin 2022) use swin2, which has fixed resolution and for larger model sizes has image size options of 192 and 256.\nNone of the crop resize method runs were doing well for vit or swin2, but were doing well for convnext."

He got rid of the fixed random seed when creating the ImageDataLoaders in the train function, giving a different training set each time (meaning the models will not be comparable, which is fine). Jeremy appends to an empty starting list tta_res the tta predictions from each model.\nFor the very last Kaggle entry: Jeremy took the two best models (in his case the ViTs) and appending their tta predictions to the list tta_res so that they were there twice. A slightly clunky way of doing a weighted average. Then he stacked them all together, took the mean of the predictions, found the argmax (index of the class with the largest prediction) and then submit in the same way as before. This is Jeremy’s process which is not particularly thoughtful, but rather mechanical, which is what he likes about it as it can probably be automated."

Jeremy just provides a small description to the submission to remind him. A better approach would be to actually write the notebook name there, which is what Jeremy normally does. Don’t change those notebooks after submission, duplicate them, make changes in the duplicate and rename them to something sensible. This all ends up back in github. Using this approach you will actually become a better deep learning practitioner. There are very few people who actually use this approach and there are very few people Jeremy comes across who are actually good deep learning practitioners. Not many people seem to know what works and what doesn’t.\nThe only way Jeremy can do this approach (small number of models) is because of already running a lot of models prior and logging their performance."

    "text": "Improving the Large Model Ensemble\nIn order to try and improve the large model ensemble, I want to share my main observation from the large model training runs: In each of the training runs, the error rate increased for the first 4-5 epochs before decreasing, and was higher after the final epoch than any of the final error rates of the smaller models. I think this means that I should train the models for longer. Granted, the error rates between the larger models and between the larger and smaller models are not comparable (they use different validation sets), so I can’t conclude anything about training performance from that comparison. However, I would generally expect the error rates of the larger models to be lower, even on different validation sets (perhaps that’s not a fair expectation).\nA secondary observation that I made is that the manner in which I calculated the TTA error rate after each training run…\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(trn_path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=Resize(224))\ntst_files = get_image_files(path/'test_images')\ntst_files.sort()\ntst_dl = dls.test_dl(tst_files)\n\nerror_rate(*learn.tta(dl=dls.valid))\n…is not correct. I should pass dls.valid using the dls used during the training to learn.tta instead of using a new DataLoaders object which has a different training/validation split, and therefore likely is including images from the training when calculating the error rate.

I noticed the same patterns in each one:\n\nThe training and validation losses are generally decreasing but tend to rise and fall a bit across the training.\n24 epochs doesn’t seem to be overfitting the model. The validation loss certainly fluctuates a bit at the end of the training (increasing and decreasing in consecutive epochs) but it is relatively flat at the end. Perhaps I’m making a mistake here, and such a flattening is a sign of the start of overfitting, but I’m going to stick to 24 epochs for now.\nThe final error rate during training is still unremarkable at around 0.02. None of the training runs resulted in anything close to the lowest error rate I had with smaller models (0.0163). Again, different validation sets will result in different error rates, but because of this lack of error rate improvement, I’m not expecting to improve my competition score significantly.\n\nNext, I’ll train the other two large models for 24 epochs each:\n\narch = 'convnext_large_in22k'\n\n\nlearn, dls = train(arch, item=Resize((640,480)), batch=aug_transforms(size=(288,224), min_scale=0.75), accum=True)\n\nDownloading: \"https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/convnext/convnext_large_22k_224.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/convnext_large_22k_224.pth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.117779\n0.660938\n0.174916\n03:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.437924\n0.200062\n0.068717\n05:09\n\n\n1\n0.315851\n0.158929\n0.048054\n05:10\n\n\n2\n0.294190\n0.167008\n0.049976\n05:09\n\n\n3\n0.240635\n0.133045\n0.040846\n05:09\n\n\n4\n0.296416\n0.199445\n0.057184\n05:10\n\n\n5\n0.223830\n0.155541\n0.044690\n05:09\n\n\n6\n0.231965\n0.144504\n0.034118\n05:09\n\n\n7\n0.176270\n0.160164\n0.041807\n05:09\n\n\n8\n0.173444\n0.175411\n0.039885\n05:09\n\n\n9\n0.154608\n0.150472\n0.040846\n05:09\n\n\n10\n0.128028\n0.119761\n0.031235\n05:09\n\n\n11\n0.081071\n0.093472\n0.020183\n05:08\n\n\n12\n0.107737\n0.099295\n0.021144\n05:08\n\n\n13\n0.096281\n0.111142\n0.024507\n05:08\n\n\n14\n0.054678\n0.078692\n0.019222\n05:08\n\n\n15\n0.039529\n0.092145\n0.024507\n05:08\n\n\n16\n0.049152\n0.084749\n0.020183\n05:07\n\n\n17\n0.029900\n0.075587\n0.014897\n05:08\n\n\n18\n0.025885\n0.088903\n0.020663\n05:07\n\n\n19\n0.016233\n0.076446\n0.017299\n05:07\n\n\n20\n0.012938\n0.069057\n0.015377\n05:07\n\n\n21\n0.017901\n0.072703\n0.013455\n05:06\n\n\n22\n0.015330\n0.076080\n0.014416\n05:06\n\n\n23\n0.027190\n0.074604\n0.014416\n05:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensorBase(0.0144)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlen(tta_res), len(tta_res[0][0]), len(tta_res[1][0])\n\n(2, 3469, 3469)\n\n\nSimilar to the large swinv2 training run, the training loss starts at a much higher value and ends up at a lower value than the validation loss. Both losses fluctuate, decreasing for the first few epochs, then increasing in epoch 4, then generally decreasing the rest of the way with small bumps.\nIt’s hard not to compare error rates across models, even though I know I shouldn’t because they are on different validation and test sets. That being said:\nAfter the final (24th) epoch, the large convnext model achieved about 30% smaller final training error rate than the large swinv2 models. The TTA error rate for convnext model (0.0144) is 20% lower than the swinv2 models (0.0183).\nLet’s see how the large vit model performs, but I am leaning towards excluding the swinv2 model from the ensemble since it seems to be the worst performing one on both validation and test set error rates. I am now also questioning whether the excellent performance of the small swinv2 model just simply doesn’t translate to the larger model. I also have to question here—am I doing something wrong in how I’m training these large models? Shouldn’t they be performing much better than their smaller counterparts? convnext certainly seems to be doing so, but swinv2 doesn’t.\n\narch = 'vit_large_patch16_224'\n\nI was running into the usual CUDA Out-Of-Memory errors, even after restarting the kernel, so I found the following code online to clear out most of the GPU cache.\n\nimport gc; gc.collect()\ntorch.cuda.empty_cache()\n\n\nlearn, dls = train(arch, item=Resize(480), batch=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75), accum=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.293154\n0.675305\n0.199423\n05:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.559790\n0.329836\n0.110524\n07:00\n\n\n1\n0.347774\n0.223555\n0.070159\n07:01\n\n\n2\n0.375485\n0.274702\n0.074003\n07:01\n\n\n3\n0.386415\n0.247032\n0.070159\n07:01\n\n\n4\n0.401717\n0.207438\n0.068236\n07:01\n\n\n5\n0.367362\n0.319452\n0.100432\n07:01\n\n\n6\n0.300632\n0.215864\n0.066314\n07:01\n\n\n7\n0.232857\n0.152640\n0.044690\n07:01\n\n\n8\n0.268405\n0.222575\n0.062470\n07:01\n\n\n9\n0.139751\n0.270562\n0.072561\n07:01\n\n\n10\n0.191241\n0.155850\n0.039885\n07:00\n\n\n11\n0.116998\n0.124926\n0.031235\n07:00\n\n\n12\n0.130736\n0.161409\n0.043248\n07:01\n\n\n13\n0.082500\n0.174184\n0.036521\n07:00\n\n\n14\n0.061503\n0.108156\n0.026430\n07:00\n\n\n15\n0.069686\n0.138058\n0.034599\n07:00\n\n\n16\n0.059782\n0.116582\n0.032196\n07:00\n\n\n17\n0.054639\n0.102705\n0.024507\n07:00\n\n\n18\n0.033125\n0.098741\n0.025949\n07:00\n\n\n19\n0.039223\n0.099548\n0.020183\n06:59\n\n\n20\n0.021738\n0.101047\n0.020183\n07:00\n\n\n21\n0.027946\n0.100101\n0.021624\n07:00\n\n\n22\n0.016446\n0.095121\n0.022585\n06:59\n\n\n23\n0.021418\n0.093120\n0.022105\n07:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensorBase(0.0197)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlen(tta_res), len(tta_res[0][0]), len(tta_res[1][0]), len(tta_res[2][0])\n\n(3, 3469, 3469, 3469)\n\n\nOnly the larger convnext model seems to be clearly out-performing its smaller counterpart.

In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition. I’m excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\nIn this blog post series, I’ll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way.

The larger vit models only work on larger images. Pleasantly surprised to see some of the vit’s didn’t use much memory and they were pretty fast. resnetrs is small and fast.\nOn PLANET, it doesn’t look that different except it’s entirely vit, swin and convnext in the top 15. vit_small_patch32_224’s memory usage is amazing.\nRunning these models took less than 3 hours on Jeremy’s three GPUs. 1200 runs.\nWhen to use larger images? Do everything you can on smaller images, as long as it gets you reasonable results, because you want to iterate quickly. Then, when you want the best accuracy you try bigger and bigger images and see what you can get away with–keep doing that as long as the accuracy improves. In a production environment it’s similar, you make it bigger and bigger until the latency of the model is too high, and you find the right trade-off between model latency and accuracy. Generally speaking, larger images will give you more accurate results but a lot slower (you end up with a lot more pixels from 224^2 to 360^2). For initial iterating you don’t need a really accurate model because you are trying to figure out what data preprocessing works best, or what architecture works best. In a business context, Jeremy would do exactly what he has done here—try a few things on small fast models on small images on a small subset of the data to find out what data preprocessing and architecture to use, and then he would look at what are the constraints in operationalizing this (how much RAM do we have, how much latency can we get away with, how expensive is it going to be) to scale it up to the point where we are getting acceptable results using acceptable resources. It wouldn’t look very different at all than a Kaggle competition in terms of the modeling, but there would be a whole piece of it around user requirements, costs, and stuff like that.\nOne student tried going from smaller to larger models but it resulted in lower accuracy (note: this is what essentially happened to me, except for the large ensemble with 3-times weighted vit model which matches the small ensemble’s private score), is it just a fluke? No, it’s not a fluke. It means you pressed the wrong buttons somehow. Re-run Jeremy’s notebooks and then look at yours and see how they’re different. And then figure out where you went wrong. When debugging, look at the inputs and outputs—what predictions are you making? For example are you always predicting 0? Did you run lr.find to see what learning rate works well? Stuff like that.\nWhen exporting a model, the format is pickle but the file extension is pth (what PyTorch uses).\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the variety column in train.csv:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\n\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_id\nlabel\nvariety\nage\n\n\n\n\n0\n100330.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n1\n100365.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n2\n100382.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n3\n100632.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n4\n101918.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n10402\n107607.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10403\n107811.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10404\n108547.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10405\n110245.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10406\n110381.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n\n\n10407 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.variety.value_counts()\n\nvariety\nADT45             6992\nKarnatakaPonni     988\nPonni              657\nAtchayaPonni       461\nZonal              399\nAndraPonni         377\nOnthanel           351\nIR20               114\nRR                  36\nSurya               32\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nAbout 70% of the ~10k rows of data are of the “ADT45” variety. But there are ~3k rows that contain other varieties. Something that is a bit counterintuitive: when there’s two different things (what kind of rice is it, what kind of disease is it) sometimes trying to get your model to predict two different things makes tham better at both. This sounds counterintuitive because you are giving it more work to do but you are also giving it more signal—things you’re teaching it to look for. So maybe if it knows how to recognize different kinds of rice, it can use that information to also recognize how different kinds of rice are impacted by different diseases. No idea if this is going to be useful or not but it would be an interesting exercise to try to do that. Also a good exercise of delving into models in a way we haven’t done before. This is going to be much more sophisticated than anything we’ve done with deep learning before. It’s a really good test of how well you understand what’s going on inside a neural network.\nJeremy trained a model three times to see what the error rate was, to see what kind of variation there is. A learning rate of 0.02 for 3 epochs gave consistent results. People are often into doing reproducible training where they have set the seed for their training and run the same thing everytime. I think that’s normally a bad idea because I actually want to see what the natural variation is and so if I make a change I want to know if the difference I see in the result is due to natural variation or it’s actually something significant. If the natural variation is very large, it’s going to be tough to see if you actually improved things. But then if the natural variation is so large that improvements are invisible then trying to improve it seems pointless because it sounds like you haven’t really found a way to stably train something. And normally that happens because the learning rate is too big. If you bump the learning rate to 0.04 you’ll see the error rate go all over the place (5%, 6^, etc.). Training for more epochs at a lower learning rate will generally give you more stable results. There’s a compromise because doing more epochs is slow. You could also try using a smaller subset of the data. In the end sometimes things will just be slow but most of the time Jeremy finds that you can get a compromise.\nWith 6 epochs at half the learning rate (0.01) the model is more accurate (4% error rate rather than 5%).\nThese improvements you make on a small scale show up on a larger scale. They pretty much always will because they are the same models with more layers or wider activations. If you find some preprocessing step that works well on a convnext tiny, it’s going to work also well on a convnext larg, 99.9% of the time. Most people act as if that’s not true, like in academia, or most people never think to try. But intuitively, of course it’s the same. Why wouldn’t it be the same? It’s the same model just scaled up a bit that behaves very similarly. You can argue that it’s intuitive, but it might not be intuitive because everybody has told you for years that it doesn’t work that way.\nI’ll run three trainings of the model as Jeremy has done, to get a sense of the variation in error rates for the convnext_tiny_in22k model:\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(\n    trn_path, seed=42, valid_pct=0.2,\n    item_tfms=Resize(480), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\n\narch = 'convnext_tiny_in22k'\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.183931\n0.734716\n0.228736\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.706453\n0.518948\n0.162422\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.408914\n0.192417\n0.058626\n01:03\n\n\n2\n0.220568\n0.127589\n0.037482\n01:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.156675\n0.834739\n0.226333\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.689531\n0.731114\n0.203268\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.420913\n0.229073\n0.076886\n01:05\n\n\n2\n0.221704\n0.140325\n0.041807\n01:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.198419\n0.696659\n0.214320\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.651208\n0.480119\n0.150889\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.429291\n0.229344\n0.069197\n01:01\n\n\n2\n0.225388\n0.136109\n0.043248\n01:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final error rates for convnext_tiny_in22k using a learning rate of 0.02 for 3 epochs were 0.037482, 0.041807, and 0.043248 (the first time I ran these three models). The largest difference in error rate between the three models was 15%. That seems not great. In the video, Jeremy’s models had a difference of 3%.\nLet’s actually look at a model. To simplify things later on (when adding new layers to handle two categories of classification) we will remove the to_fp16 call.\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate)\n\n\nm = learn.model\n\nThere are two things at the top of the model:\n\nTimmBody (which has multiple things in it, the first being the model, which in turn has multiple things, the first being the stem, the next being stages and so on).\n\nThe body does all the hard work of looking at the pixels and trying to find features and things like that. In this case it’s a convolutional neural network. At the very end of it it spits out a whole bunch of information about those pixels.\n\nthe head ((1): Sequential).\n\nthe head makes sense of what the body spits out and returns predictions. The head is pretty simple, the body is not.\n\n\nWe want to predict two things: what kind of rice it is and what disease it has. Currently the very last layer is a linear layer:\n(8): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=10, bias=False)\nA lineary layer is something that does a matrix product, with an input of 512 features and output of 10 features. A 512 x 10 matrix.\nLet’s grab the head (which is the index-1 thing in the model)\n\nh = m[1]\n\n\nh\n\nSequential(\n  (0): AdaptiveConcatPool2d(\n    (ap): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=1)\n    (mp): AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size=1)\n  )\n  (1): fastai.layers.Flatten(full=False)\n  (2): BatchNorm1d(1536, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (3): Dropout(p=0.25, inplace=False)\n  (4): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=512, bias=False)\n  (5): ReLU(inplace=True)\n  (6): BatchNorm1d(512, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (7): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)\n  (8): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=10, bias=False)\n)\n\n\nIs there a way to see the shape of the data as it flows through the model?\nYes, with learn.summary() (full output is too long so showing a snippet here). The 64 is because we are using a batch size of 64. For each image we are predicting 10 probabitilies (for 10 classes of disease).\nSequential (Input shape: 64 x 3 x 224 x 224)\n============================================================================\nLayer (type)         Output Shape         Param #    Trainable \n============================================================================\n\n...\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n                     64 x 1536           \nFlatten                                                        \nBatchNorm1d                               3072       True      \nDropout                                                        \n____________________________________________________________________________\n                     64 x 512            \nLinear                                    786432     True      \nReLU                                                           \nBatchNorm1d                               1024       True      \nDropout                                                        \n____________________________________________________________________________\n                     64 x 10             \nLinear                                    5120       True      \n____________________________________________________________________________\nLet’s look at the last layer of the head:\n\nll = h[-1]\n\n\nll\n\nLinear(in_features=512, out_features=10, bias=False)\n\n\nWe can view the parameters in the layer, which are generated lazily so we have to put it in a list to force it to generate them:\n\nllp = list(ll.parameters())[0]\n\n\nllp.shape\n\ntorch.Size([10, 512])\n\n\nThe last layer parameters (llp) is a matrix which is 10 x 512. We’re getting 512 inputs, and when we multiply them by this matrix we get 10 outputs.\nIf we removed this layer, the last layer would be taking in 1536 features and spitting out 512 features:\n(4): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=512, bias=False)\nWe’ll delete it, and then take those 512 features and create two linear layers for them, one with 10 outputs as before (for disease classification) and one with 10 outputs for variety classification (there are 10 varieties). The final output would be 2 x 10 for each image—one with probabilities for disease classes, and one for variety classes.\nLet’s do the easy thing first which is to delete the layer we don’t want. A PyTorch Sequential takes the output of each layer and passes it as the input to the next layer. If we delete the last layer, that’s no problem, it just won’t ever call it. PyTorch’s Sequential has normal list semantics so you can delete a layer like so:\n\ndel(h[-1])\n\n\nh\n\nSequential(\n  (0): AdaptiveConcatPool2d(\n    (ap): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=1)\n    (mp): AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size=1)\n  )\n  (1): fastai.layers.Flatten(full=False)\n  (2): BatchNorm1d(1536, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (3): Dropout(p=0.25, inplace=False)\n  (4): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=512, bias=False)\n  (5): ReLU(inplace=True)\n  (6): BatchNorm1d(512, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (7): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)\n)\n\n\nWe’re going to create a class which includes this model and adds the final two layers:\n\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(\n    trn_path, seed=42, valid_pct=0.2,\n    item_tfms=Resize(480), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn2 = deepcopy(learn)\n\n\nclass DiseaseAndTypeClassifier(nn.Module):\n    # the constructor\n    def __init__(self, m):\n        super().__init__() # always call the superclass init to construct the object\n        self.l1 = nn.Linear(512, 10, bias=False) # variety\n        self.l2 = nn.Linear(512, 10, bias=False) # disease\n        del(m[1][-1]) # delete the last layer of the model's head\n        self.m = m # model\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.m(x)\n        x1 = self.l1(x) # variety output\n        x2 = self.l2(x) # disease output\n        return x1, x2\n\n\ndtc = DiseaseAndTypeClassifier(learn2.model)\nlearn2.model = dtc\n\nWhen calling get_preds even though with_loss=False the Learner is still needing to use the loss function for something. So, we’ll write the new loss function. The loss function is the thing which is a number which says how good is this model. The loss function that we were using was designed on something that only returned a single tensor. And now we’re returning a tuple of tensors (x1, x2). So that’s why when it tries to call the loss function, it gets confused.\nThe loss function is another thing that is stored inside the Learner.\n\nlearn.loss_func\n\nFlattenedLoss of CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\nIn the initial new loss function, we’ll just return the loss for the disease predictions using the current loss function. We don’t have to split the targs yet because currently they hold just the disease targets. We’re going to have to change our data loading as well to include the rice variety as well.\nWhy is the loss function determined from the dataset? (As seen in the Learner source code).\nGenerally speaking, what is the appropriate loss function to use as a reasonable default depends on what kind of data you have. So if you’re data is a single continuous output you probably have a regression problem so you probably want mean squared error. If it’s a single categorical variable you probably want cross entropy loss. If you have a mult-categorical variable you probably want log loss without softmax. And so forth. By having it come from the dataset means that you can get sensible defaults that ought to work for that dataset. That’s why we generally don’t have to specify what loss function to use unless we’re doing something non-standard.\n\ncurr_loss = learn2.loss_func\n\n\ndef dtc_loss(preds, targs):\n    rice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n    return curr_loss(dis_preds, targs)\n\n\ndef dtc_error(preds, targs):\n    rice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n    return error_rate(dis_preds, targs)\n\n\nlearn2.loss_func = dtc_loss\nlearn2.metrics = [dtc_error]\n\n\nlearn2.loss_func\n\n&lt;function __main__.dtc_loss(preds, targs)&gt;\n\n\n\nlearn2.metrics\n\n(#1) [&lt;fastai.learner.AvgMetric object at 0x78339534eb00&gt;]\n\n\nAt this point we should be able to get some predictions to verify that the plumbing is working.\n\npreds, targs = learn2.get_preds(dl=learn2.dls.valid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve now got two sets of preditions, variety, and disease.\n\nlen(preds)\n\n2\n\n\n\npreds\n\n(tensor([[ 1.4707,  1.5254, -1.5469,  ...,  3.5859, -9.7422, -7.9531],\n         [ 2.8262, -0.3391, -1.0713,  ...,  3.9258, -6.7891, -5.5508],\n         [ 1.2178,  0.2090, -1.3574,  ...,  2.4629, -6.9688, -6.0234],\n         ...,\n         [ 1.2422,  0.5278, -0.7520,  ...,  1.9199, -7.2109, -6.4258],\n         [ 2.9219, -0.2183, -1.1211,  ...,  1.8584, -6.8516, -6.2461],\n         [ 2.0469,  0.6406, -1.3174,  ...,  3.8027, -9.2891, -5.8086]],\n        dtype=torch.float16),\n tensor([[ 2.8516, -2.9395, -3.2852,  ...,  1.3027, -1.5234, -2.8223],\n         [ 3.4375, -1.3428, -3.8047,  ..., -0.9033, -0.5435, -3.0449],\n         [ 4.1719, -1.0127, -2.9375,  ..., -0.5962,  0.7446, -3.3828],\n         ...,\n         [ 3.5781, -1.2656, -2.3008,  ..., -0.3660, -0.0957, -4.2734],\n         [ 4.9727, -0.4153, -2.6562,  ...,  0.9844,  0.7559, -3.6738],\n         [ 6.0703, -1.4375, -3.6797,  ..., -1.5928,  2.6211, -5.0625]],\n        dtype=torch.float16))\n\n\n\nrice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n\n\ndis_preds.shape\n\ntorch.Size([2081, 10])\n\n\nInitially, Jeremy got some errors when running learn2.get_preds(dl=learn2.dls.valid). To debug them, he first tried to get a minimum reproducible example—not changing learn.model to dtc. This still threw an error. Then, instead of running learn2 = copy(learn) he assigned to learn2 the line vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).\nThat didn’t solve the problem either. Something was keeping some part of the Learner’s state in half-precision. Finally, Jeremy tried restarting the kernel. That solved the problem, and the get_preds call was successful.\nHe also got an error because the metrics function was trying to calculate on a tuple of preds, so in order to test just the new loss function at first, we removed the metrics from the Learner.\nWe should be able to replicate our disease clasification model at this point because we’re not doing anything with the extra rice type (variety).\n\nlearn2.model_dir = '/tmp/model'\n\n\nlearn2.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=0.0063095735386013985)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe valley (0.01) is pretty conservative so Jeremy recommends picking a learning rate further down the curve (0.1) which seems more reasonable.

I’m excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\nIn this blog post series, I’ll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way. My last two blog posts in this series reference Jeremy’s Scaling Up: Road to the Top, Part 3 notebook to improve my large model ensemble predictions. Here are the links to each of the blog posts in this series:\n\nPart 1: Live Coding 8\nPart 2: Live Coding 9\nPart 3: Live Coding 10\nPart 4: Live Coding 11\nPart 5: Live Coding 12\nPart 6: Live Coding 13 (You are here)\nPart 7: Improving My Large Ensemble, Part 1\nPart 8: Improving My Large Ensemble, Part 2\n\nLink to Live Coding 13\n\n\n\n!pip install -qq timm==0.6.13\nimport timm\ntimm.__version__\n\n'0.6.13'\n\n\n\n# install fastkaggle if not available\ntry: import fastkaggle\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError:\n    !pip install -Uq fastkaggle\n\nfrom fastkaggle import *\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\ncomp = 'paddy-disease-classification'\npath = setup_comp(comp, install='fastai')\n\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.24.3\n  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n\n\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#4) [Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/sample_submission.csv'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train.csv'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/test_images')]\n\n\n\ntrn_path = path/'train_images'\n\n\n\n\nJeremy re-did his approach to the multi-head (multi-task) classification that we started in the last live coding session. Spoiler alert: it didn’t turn out to help our final score, the score was about the same. As soon as Jeremy turned off Zoom and went for a walk, he realized how he should approach this problem. We can make this much much simpler.\nWe are going to try to predict two things: the disease and the variety for each image. The first thing is to create a pair of DataLoaders:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      image_id\n      label\n      variety\n      age\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      100330.jpg\n      bacterial_leaf_blight\n      ADT45\n      45\n    \n    \n      1\n      100365.jpg\n      bacterial_leaf_blight\n      ADT45\n      45\n    \n    \n      2\n      100382.jpg\n      bacterial_leaf_blight\n      ADT45\n      45\n    \n    \n      3\n      100632.jpg\n      bacterial_leaf_blight\n      ADT45\n      45\n    \n    \n      4\n      101918.jpg\n      bacterial_leaf_blight\n      ADT45\n      45\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreate what we had starting from the small models where Jeremy used ImageDataLoaders which is the highest-level, least-flexible function where you can do all of the data processing in a single line of code but only if we want to do something really standard. Trying to predict two things is not standard enough for it.\nWe need to go one layer down. All of the work in ImageDataLoaders is being done by DataBlock, which is still high-level API but very flexible.\nHere’s how to setup a DataBlock for disease classification:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items = get_image_files,\n    get_y = parent_label,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(trn_path)\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the source code of ImageBlock:\ndef ImageBlock(cls:PILBase=PILImage):\n    \"A `TransformBlock` for images of `cls`\"\n    return TransformBlock(type_tfms=cls.create, batch_tfms=IntToFloatTensor)\nWhich calls PILImage.create, which returns an Image from a filename:\n\nPILImage.create?\n\n\nSignature:\nPILImage.create(\n    fn: 'Path | str | Tensor | ndarray | bytes | Image.Image',\n    **kwargs,\n)\nDocstring: Return an Image from `fn`\nFile:      /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastai/vision/core.py\nType:      method\n\n\n\nget_image_files will return a list of Paths:\n\nget_image_files(trn_path)\n\n(#10407) [Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/109629.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/104765.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/109706.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/100098.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/102734.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/106433.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/108930.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/102019.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/102416.jpg'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/101046.jpg')...]\n\n\nThese Paths are passed into PILImage.create to create an image:\n\nPILImage.create(get_image_files(trn_path)[0])\n\n\n\n\nWe have now just replicated what is happening in the code with ImageBlock (which also converts the PILImage object into a tensor with IntToFloatTensor).\nJeremy then made sure that the DataBlock approach to create the DataLoaders resulted in a successful training run, making sure to use a very small model and small image size to make it run quickly (as all we’re testing is that it trains it correctly).\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items = get_image_files,\n    get_y = parent_label,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=128, min_scale=0.75))\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(trn_path)\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.01)\n\nDownloading:

something that works this quickly so that you can test that end-to-end things are working.\nNote: fastai will shuffle the training dataset before each epoch to ensure the model is trained on a different order of images each epoch.\nThen, Jeremy ran the training run on the same architecture and number of epochs as before to make sure he got the same error rate:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items = get_image_files,\n    get_y = parent_label,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n

error rate (~0.02) is similar to the original training done using the DataLoaders made from ImageDataLoaders.\n\n\n\nOne image and two categories (disease and variety). To get it to spit out two categories, you add another CategoryBlock.\nGiven an image id we need a way of getting its variety. Originally Jeremy handled it with “an ugly way” of doing it. Instead create a dict which maps from image_id to variety, and our function will be to just look that up.\n\nimg2variety = { r.image_id: r.variety for _, r in df.iterrows() }\n\n\ndict(list(img2variety.items())[0:10])\n\n{'100330.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '100365.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '100382.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '100632.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '101918.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '102353.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '102848.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '103051.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '103702.jpg': 'ADT45',\n '103920.jpg': 'ADT45'}\n\n\nWhen you access a dict item, like img2variety['100330.jpg'], behind the scenes it’s making a function call img2variety.__getitem__('100330.jpg')\n\nimg2variety.__getitem__('100330.jpg')\n\n'ADT45'\n\n\nHowever, in the DataBlock, get_image_files returns a bunch of Path objects which get passed to the get_y function to get the dependent variables. Since img2variety keys are filename strings, we need to wrap it in a function to handle Path object inputs:\n\ndef get_variety(p): return img2variety[p.name]\n\nWe need to tell the DataBlock how many of the blocks are independent variables with n_inp.\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    get_y = [parent_label, get_variety],\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\nBefore creating DataLoaders, test with Datasets as they are easier to debug (can access one image at a time instead of a batch).\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\n\n\nimg, y1, y2 = dss.train[0]\n\n\nimg\n\n\n\n\n\ny1\n\nTensorCategory(3)\n\n\n\ny2\n\nTensorCategory(0)\n\n\nLet’s recreate the pipeline of going from filename to these three outputs:\n\nfn = get_image_files(trn_path)[0]\n\n\nfn, fn.name\n\n(Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/tungro/109629.jpg'),\n '109629.jpg')\n\n\nRecreating what the ImageBlock does:\n\nPILImage.create(fn)\n\n\n\n\nRecreating what get_y does:\n\n[parent_label(fn), get_variety(fn)]\n\n['tungro', 'ADT45']\n\n\nWould it make sense to have multiple get_items? No, get_items returns a single thing, but it could be whatever you like (tuple, list, dict, etc.). Then get_y and get_x are responsible for pulling out the bit that you need to pass to your blocks. We don’t need get_x in this case because ImageBlocks just take Paths as inputs directly.\nHere is the “hacky” method Jeremy tried originally:\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_x = lambda x: trn_path/x[1]/x[0],\n    get_y = [ColReader(1), ColReader(2)],\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\n\n\nNow we’ll go into the weeds.\n\nTransformBlock??\n\n\nInit signature:\nTransformBlock(\n    type_tfms: 'list' = None,\n    item_tfms: 'list' = None,\n    batch_tfms: 'list' = None,\n    dl_type: 'TfmdDL' = None,\n    dls_kwargs: 'dict' = None,\n)\nSource:        \nclass TransformBlock():\n    \"A basic wrapper that links defaults transforms for the data block API\"\n    def __init__(self, \n        type_tfms:list=None, # One or more `Transform`s\n        item_tfms:list=None, # `ItemTransform`s, applied on an item\n        batch_tfms:list=None, # `Transform`s or `RandTransform`s, applied by batch\n        dl_type:TfmdDL=None, # Task specific `TfmdDL`, defaults to `TfmdDL`\n        dls_kwargs:dict=None, # Additional arguments to be passed to `DataLoaders`\n    ):\n        self.type_tfms  =            L(type_tfms)\n        self.item_tfms  = ToTensor + L(item_tfms)\n        self.batch_tfms =            L(batch_tfms)\n        self.dl_type,self.dls_kwargs = dl_type,({} if dls_kwargs is None else dls_kwargs)\nFile:           /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastai/data/block.py\nType:           type\nSubclasses:     \n\n\n\nA TransformBlock stores a bunch of things you pass in, like type transforms, item transforms, batch transforms, it always adds ToTensor since PyTorch works with tensors. Remember that an ImageBlock is a TransformBlock where the type transform is specified as PILImage.create and the batch transform is IntToTensor.\nIf you pass TransformBlock to the DataBlock.blocks, it wont do anything.\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\n\n\ndss.train[0]\n\n(Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast/105663.jpg'),)\n\n\nAll this does is take the output of get_image_files[0] and turns it into a tuple containing one thing, which is the thing itself. If we have two transform blocks, it returns a tuple with two things in it:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n(Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast/105663.jpg'),\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast/105663.jpg'))\n\n\nIt’s returning tuples because that’s what we want: we want batches of tuples that contain inputs and outputs (potentially multiple inputs and outputs).\nWe can do stuff to the first thing in the tuple with get_x:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    get_x=lambda o: o.name,\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n('105663.jpg',\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast/105663.jpg'))\n\n\no.name for each get_image_files output is the filename. We can do stuff to the second thing in the tuple with get_y:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    get_x=lambda o: o.name,\n    get_y=lambda o: o.parent,\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n('105663.jpg',\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'))\n\n\nTransformBlocks don’t do anything but the number of them you have is the number of pipelines it’s going to create. Suppose we had three TransformBlocks assigned to DataBlock.blocks—this will require a total of three functions between get_x and get_y:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock, TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    get_x=[lambda o: o.name, lambda o: o.name],\n    get_y=lambda o: o.parent,\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n('105663.jpg',\n '105663.jpg',\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'))\n\n\nBy default, the last one in the tuple is the y and the first two are the x, unless we specify n_inp as 1, provide 1 function for get_x and then two functions for get_y:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock, TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_x=lambda o: o.name,\n    get_y=[lambda o: o.parent, lambda o: o.parent],\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n('105663.jpg',\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'),\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'))\n\n\nYou can also pass the functions to TransformBlock.type_tfms instead:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock(type_tfms=[lambda o: o.name]), TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_y=[lambda o: o.parent, lambda o: o.parent],\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n('105663.jpg',\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'),\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'))\n\n\nLet’s create an ImageBlock manually:\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(TransformBlock(type_tfms=PILImage.create, batch_tfms=IntToFloatTensor), TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_y=[lambda o: o.parent, lambda o: o.parent],\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=480x640,\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'),\n Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images/blast'))\n\n\nTransformBlocks don’t do anything at all, they only store things. There’s no __call__, there’s no __forward__, etc. The DataBlock is going to go through and say okay for each thing (from get_image_files) call each of the type_tfms and ToTensor and then each of the item_tfms and for batches call each of the batch_tfms of each TransformBlock.\nget_x and get_y get called first and then type_tfms of TransformBlocks get called on their outputs.\nWhen you call DataBlock.datasets it creates a Datasets object and passes in all of the type, item and batch transforms to it. The item transform gets done by the DataLoaders and not the Datasets.\nThe only reason there’s a lot of code defining the DataBlock is to make sure that if two different things have the same type transforms, we merge them together in a sensible way. Type transforms are happening before DataLoaders time. DataLoaders are the things that are going to take tensors or at least things that can be converted into tensors. Type transforms are going to create your Datasets for you and spit out things which need to be convertible into tensors. And then DataLoaders has item transforms which are things like Resize and batch transforms which are things like data augmentation.\nItem transforms are not going to run on GPU because the items aren’t a batch yet. You need things in a batch before the GPU can be optimized effectively.\nThere is a callback which sticks things on the GPU. It just depends on whether things done are before or after that callback.\nThe fastai implementation of DataLoaders is a superset of PyTorch’s implementation.\nPyTorch’s Dataset is an abstract class and doesn’t do anything at all. A Dataset is something you can index into and it returns a single tuple with independent and dependent variables. That’s how it’s defined by PyTorch and that’s what fastai does as well.\nYou can’t index into a DataLoader, you can only iterate through it, you can grab the next one and it gives you a mini-batch which is a tensor.\nYou need something that converts the output of get_image_files into a Dataset and that’s what type_tfms do.\nThis is not the only way you could do this, but it’s our way that’s really nice because we now have this thing that you can see the 14th image and its label. If we didn’t have type transforms it would be just one more step in item transforms—your Datasets would return two things (outputs of get_x and get_y) and then the DataLoader would have to do more work which would be a perfectly okay way to do things.\nThe rule is that you need something that can be turned into a tensor. That’s the way fastai does it. You need to make sure that your type transform returns something that is a tensor or can be turned into a tensor (which a PILImage can be).\n\n\n\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, TransformBlock, TransformBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_y=[lambda o: o.parent.name, get_variety],\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=480x640, 'blast', 'ADT45')\n\n\nThis breaks our rule because the last two things can’t be turned into a tensor (they are strings). What do we do with that? W replace strings with integers that are a lookup into the vocabulary. If we change the last two TransformBlocks into CategoryBlocks, that is exactly what CategoryBlock will do.\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_y=[lambda o: o.parent.name, get_variety],\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n)\n\ndss = dblock.datasets(trn_path)\ndss.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=480x640, TensorCategory(3), TensorCategory(0))\n\n\nCategoryBlock has a type transform called Categorize.\n\nCategoryBlock??\n\n\n\nSignature:\nCategoryBlock(\n    vocab: 'MutableSequence | pd.Series' = None,\n    sort: 'bool' = True,\n    add_na: 'bool' = False,\n)\nSource:   \ndef CategoryBlock(\n    vocab:MutableSequence|pd.Series=None, # List of unique class names\n    sort:bool=True, # Sort the classes alphabetically\n    add_na:bool=False, # Add `#na#` to `vocab`\n):\n    \"`TransformBlock` for single-label categorical targets\"\n    return TransformBlock(type_tfms=Categorize(vocab=vocab, sort=sort, add_na=add_na))\nFile:      /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/fastai/data/block.py\nType:      function\n\n\n\n\ndss.vocab\n\n(#2) [['bacterial_leaf_blight', 'bacterial_leaf_streak', 'bacterial_panicle_blight', 'blast', 'brown_spot', 'dead_heart', 'downy_mildew', 'hispa', 'normal', 'tungro'],['ADT45', 'AndraPonni', 'AtchayaPonni', 'IR20', 'KarnatakaPonni', 'Onthanel', 'Ponni', 'RR', 'Surya', 'Zonal']]\n\n\nTo summarize: get_items gets us the rows or the examples, then we use get_y or get_x to transform it somehow so that we can pass it into the type_tfms of those blocks. The blocks are very general things, so Jeremy didn’t want us to have to write our own every time—ImageBlock will work if you pass it an image path, CategoryBlock will work if you pass it a string. So get_x and get_y then are responsible for ensuring that you pass ImageBlock a Path and CategoryBlock a string. Note that get_image_files is already returning a path so we don’t need a get_x, but it’s not returning strings so we do need a get_y.\nLet’s return to the full DataBlock for multi-classification. Some other time Jeremy will talk about how item_tfms are not applies to the categories but only to the images. The secret is using fastcore’s type dispatch functionality. If we had an image for the y, the item_tfms would apply (see the siamese tutorial on the fastai docs, because that has two images). If you think about it, anytime we do segmentation, that’s what’s happening—data augmentation is happening to x and y. This is really unusual, Jeremy doesn’t know if any other libraries that have this kind of totally transparent ability to do bounding boxes, segmentation, point clouds, whatever as dependent variables and have it all happen in unison very automatically (or at least there didn’t use to be—maybe there is now).\n\ndblock = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    n_inp=1,\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    get_y = [parent_label, get_variety],\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.2, seed=42),\n    item_tfms=Resize(480, method='squish'),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\n\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(trn_path)\n\nfastai does a lot of things automatically because of type dispatch.\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\nAll the stuff we did last time about messing around with multiple different heads and all that is actually totally unecessary. All we need to do when we create our vision_learner is tell it we don’t want 10 outputs but we want 20 outputs.\nThen you need to tell it what loss function to use:\n\norig_lf = CrossEntropyLossFlat()\n\ndef disease_err(inp, disease, variety): return error_rate(inp[:,:10], disease)\ndef variety_err(inp, disease, variety): return error_rate(inp[:,10:], variety)\ndef disease_loss(inp, disease, variety): return orig_lf(inp[:,:10], disease)\ndef variety_loss(inp, disease, variety): return orig_lf(inp[:,10:], variety)\ndef loss(pred, disease, variety): return orig_lf(pred[:,:10], disease)+orig_lf(pred[:,10:],variety)\n\n\nerr_metrics = (disease_err, variety_err)\nall_metrics = err_metrics+(disease_loss, variety_loss)\n\n\narch = 'convnext_small_in22k'\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, loss_func=loss, metrics=all_metrics, n_out=20).to_fp16()\n\nDownloading: \"https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/convnext/convnext_small_22k_224.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/convnext_small_22k_224.pth\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(12, 0.01) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      disease_err\n      variety_err\n      disease_loss\n      variety_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      2.029203\n      1.043733\n      0.209515\n      0.130226\n      0.610881\n      0.432852\n      01:24\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      disease_err\n      variety_err\n      disease_loss\n      variety_loss\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.859452\n      0.475814\n      0.102355\n      0.057665\n      0.314314\n      0.161500\n      01:36\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.581024\n      0.325289\n      0.077847\n      0.029313\n      0.224519\n      0.100770\n      01:37\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.540563\n      0.316766\n      0.068717\n      0.036040\n      0.212697\n      0.104069\n      01:38\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.452651\n      0.236399\n      0.060548\n      0.016338\n      0.188092\n      0.048306\n      01:32\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.336122\n      0.212508\n      0.044210\n      0.014416\n      0.167000\n      0.045508\n      01:32\n    \n    \n      5\n      0.237758\n      0.175937\n      0.040365\n      0.011533\n      0.137471\n      0.038466\n      01:31\n    \n    \n      6\n      0.188718\n      0.135600\n      0.023546\n      0.008169\n      0.099861\n      0.035739\n      01:31\n    \n    \n      7\n      0.144555\n      0.124381\n      0.021144\n      0.008650\n      0.089832\n      0.034549\n      01:31\n    \n    \n      8\n      0.118053\n      0.110137\n      0.021624\n      0.006728\n      0.081897\n      0.028240\n      01:31\n    \n    \n      9\n      0.085133\n      0.105757\n      0.021144\n      0.005766\n      0.080176\n      0.025581\n      01:31\n    \n    \n      10\n      0.063399\n      0.100818\n      0.022105\n      0.004805\n      0.075001\n      0.025817\n      01:32\n    \n    \n      11\n      0.060191\n      0.098222\n      0.020183\n      0.006247\n      0.073829\n      0.024393\n      01:31\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThe final error rate for disease classification (~0.02) is similar to what I got with single-classification.\nThe fastai inference functions have options to decode the predictions, or to use the activation function. But since Jeremy defined a new loss function, you would need to add a softmax to the 20 outputs. You actually don’t need to because for the Kaggle competition, we just needed which disease had the highest prediction, and whether it’s softmax or not, it’s going to be the same because that’s a monotonic function. So it depends whether you actually needs probabilities or not.\nBut you only want to be looking at the first 10 for disease predictions:\navg_pr = t_tta.mean(0)\navg_pr[:,:10].shape\n\nidxs = avg_pr[:,:10].argmax(dim=1)\nAll the resnets and convnexts handle any input image size, it’s only the transformer models that don’t.\nIn my next blog post I work on improving my large ensemble predictions based on how Jeremy created his large ensemble."

    "text": "Using lr_find for Large Models\nOne of the students in Live coding 12 faced the same problem as I did: their large model ensemble submission did not improve their Kaggle scores. Jeremy said this is probably because they ran some incorrect code somewhere, and suggested (among other things), to see if using a learning rate from lr_find improved their ensemble. This is what I’ll try next to improve my Kaggle score.

This is a good sign as this shows an improvement in error rate compared to the error rate (0.01862) when using a learning rate of 0.01. However, the improvement is only 5%, which seems unremarkable.\nThe training and validation losses look okay. The both decrease over epochs, and the validation loss does not seem to be increasing significantly at the end, so the model is not overfitting.\n\nI’m not convinced that changing the learning rate from 0.01 to 0.005 has significantly improved my model, but I will go ahead and train the other two models in this ensemble and submit the predictions to Kaggle. If the private score does not improve, I’ll reference Jeremy’s “Road to the Top” notebook series to see how he trained his large models.\n\nlen(tta_res), len(tta_res[0][0])\n\n(1, 3469)\n\n\n\narch = 'convnext_large_in22k'\n\n\nlearn, dls = train(\n    arch,\n    item=Resize((640,480)),\n    batch=aug_transforms(size=(288,224), min_scale=0.75),\n    lr=0.015,\n    n_epochs=24,\n    accum=True)\n\nDownloading: \"https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/convnext/convnext_large_22k_224.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/convnext_large_22k_224.pth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      error_rate\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1.350656\n      0.639466\n      0.192696\n      03:17\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      error_rate\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.393383\n      0.226754\n      0.069678\n      05:01\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.278609\n      0.194963\n      0.054301\n      05:00\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.258872\n      0.242242\n      0.069678\n      04:59\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.272949\n      0.242155\n      0.070639\n      05:01\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.250942\n      0.288342\n      0.073042\n      04:59\n    \n    \n      5\n      0.256650\n      0.224654\n      0.060067\n      05:00\n    \n    \n      6\n      0.215623\n      0.242569\n      0.054781\n      04:59\n    \n    \n      7\n      0.204849\n      0.183193\n      0.049495\n      04:59\n    \n    \n      8\n      0.175016\n      0.224864\n      0.044210\n      04:58\n    \n    \n      9\n      0.179674\n      0.374226\n      0.078328\n      04:58\n    \n    \n      10\n      0.105390\n      0.209836\n      0.037482\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      11\n      0.088776\n      0.209220\n      0.039404\n      04:58\n    \n    \n      12\n      0.071399\n      0.180012\n      0.034118\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      13\n      0.066381\n      0.153438\n      0.030754\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      14\n      0.062488\n      0.146692\n      0.028832\n      04:58\n    \n    \n      15\n      0.062825\n      0.142316\n      0.026430\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      16\n      0.044528\n      0.153894\n      0.025949\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      17\n      0.043213\n      0.144824\n      0.024027\n      04:56\n    \n    \n      18\n      0.018004\n      0.145353\n      0.022585\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      19\n      0.024245\n      0.138911\n      0.021624\n      04:59\n    \n    \n      20\n      0.009057\n      0.139719\n      0.022105\n      04:57\n    \n    \n      21\n      0.015471\n      0.134287\n      0.020663\n      04:56\n    \n    \n      22\n      0.020319\n      0.135233\n      0.021624\n      04:56\n    \n    \n      23\n      0.011382\n      0.138716\n      0.019702\n      04:57\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      25.00% [1/4 00:24<01:12]\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      58.78% [77/131 00:14<00:09 0.0114]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nTensorBase(0.0197)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are my observations:\n\nThe larger learning rate of 0.015, although reasonably estimated from the lr_find plot, has decreased the performance of the model. The final validation error rate with lr=0.015 is 0.019702, which is larger than the final validation error rate with lr=0.01 (0.014416). I’ll stick with this for now—perhaps this difference in validation error rate can be attributed to the difference in validation sets. Again, if my large model ensemble does not result in an improved Kaggle score, I’ll reference Jeremy’s solution.\nThe training and validation losses are generally decreasing over the epochs, and are not showing signs of overfitting (i.e., validation loss increasing).\n\nI’ll train the final model next.\n\nlen(tta_res), len(tta_res[0][0]), len(tta_res[1][0])\n\n(2, 3469, 3469)\n\n\n\n# save_pickle(\"colab_tta_res.pkl\", tta_res)\n\n\n# tta_res = load_pickle(\"colab_tta_res.pkl\")\n\n\narch = 'vit_large_patch16_224'\n\n\nlearn, dls = train(\n    arch,\n    item=Resize(480),\n    batch=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75),\n    lr=0.005,\n    n_epochs=24,\n    accum=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      error_rate\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1.163018\n      0.609755\n      0.195579\n      04:13\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      epoch\n      train_loss\n      valid_loss\n      error_rate\n      time\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.495968\n      0.220330\n      0.067756\n      06:21\n    \n    \n      1\n      0.365600\n      0.222172\n      0.073522\n      06:22\n    \n    \n      2\n      0.306510\n      0.231306\n      0.064873\n      06:22\n    \n    \n      3\n      0.312357\n      0.164647\n      0.044690\n      06:21\n    \n    \n      4\n      0.326301\n      0.223919\n      0.060548\n      06:21\n    \n    \n      5\n      0.291703\n      0.213934\n      0.057665\n      06:21\n    \n    \n      6\n      0.221403\n      0.221377\n      0.055262\n      06:18\n    \n    \n      7\n      0.234319\n      0.178601\n      0.044690\n      06:19\n    \n    \n      8\n      0.171401\n      0.246879\n      0.049976\n      06:18\n    \n    \n      9\n      0.194408\n      0.148840\n      0.035079\n      06:18\n    \n    \n      10\n      0.145152\n      0.149591\n      0.041326\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      11\n      0.113229\n      0.159672\n      0.032196\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      12\n      0.085892\n      0.125524\n      0.020663\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      13\n      0.053963\n      0.106966\n      0.023546\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      14\n      0.110243\n      0.099779\n      0.024507\n      06:16\n    \n    \n      15\n      0.048981\n      0.129755\n      0.031235\n      06:18\n    \n    \n      16\n      0.055013\n      0.106256\n      0.017299\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      17\n      0.043242\n      0.111034\n      0.021624\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      18\n      0.034097\n      0.097368\n      0.016819\n      06:16\n    \n    \n      19\n      0.035058\n      0.098730\n      0.017780\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      20\n      0.030310\n      0.098341\n      0.014897\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      21\n      0.019945\n      0.096790\n      0.013936\n      06:17\n    \n    \n      22\n      0.010267\n      0.095050\n      0.014416\n      06:18\n    \n    \n      23\n      0.015022\n      0.094428\n      0.014416\n      06:19\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      25.00% [1/4 00:45<02:16]\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      18.43% [40/217 00:08<00:38 0.0150]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTensorBase(0.0139)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlen(tta_res), len(tta_res[0][0]), len(tta_res[1][0]), len(tta_res[2][0])\n\n(3, 3469, 3469, 3469)\n\n\nObservations about this training:\n\nThe final validation error rate for lr=0.005 was 0.014416, which is about 35% less than when lr=0.01 (0.02215).

    "section": "Final Thoughts",
    "text": "Final Thoughts\nI really really enjoyed working through the 6-part live coding series which resulted in this 8-part blog post mini-series. I learned so much across a wide variety of topics. It was also required a lot of patience and tenacity. I ran into endless errors or issues using Kaggle and Google Colab running the trainings for the first 7 blog posts. For some unknown reason, when I was using Kaggle (whether it was in Chrome or Firefox, Incognito/Private Window and otherwise) the tab kept crashing with an “Aw, snap” error (Chrome) or “Gah” error (Firefox). Each time, I lost progress and had to re-run the model training, sometimes losing 4-5 hours of progress because of this. In Google Colab, initially it was smooth sailing until I ran out of compute units (which always show 0 anyways in the free tier). I was debating whether to purchase 100 Google Colab compute units for 10 dollars. I decided instead to upgrade my Paperspace subscription to Pro for 8 dollars/month and thus got access to faster GPUs for “free”. However, that didn’t come without a catch! You can only run free tier GPUs for 6 hours before Paperspace automatically shuts it down. Fortunately, my model training runs in this notebook only took about 4-ish hours, so I escaped unscathed.\nA few takeaways:\n\nI now understand what Jeremy meant when he said that you don’t really need to use lr_find because common problems in vision all require a similar learning rate. It didn’t matter whether I was using large or small versions of convnext, swinv2 or vit architectures, for 12 or 24 epochs. A learning rate of 0.01 for all scenarios performed the best.\nAll three of the architectures I used are pretty stable. There is variance in the final epoch validation error rate, but even after 15 different submissions, with different combinations of architectures, epochs and learning rates, the Kaggle maximum score didn’t break 0.98617.\nKaggle competitions are thrilling even when I submit scores after the competition is closed. I enjoyed trying to beat my previous score (and attempting to beat Jeremy’s score—with his own code and approach). Each time I submitted a CSV, I was excited to see the results. I can imagine the thrill when the competition is live. It must be so stressful as well! I am looking forward to competing in a live competition in 2024.\nIt’s important to both pace myself and be consistent. There were days where I couldn’t get nything accomplished on this project. There were also days where I watched and took notes on an entire live coding video from start to finish, and there were days in between. That’s fine. It happens! What’s important is to not give up just because one particular week (or month) is not producing much output. I also found that my persistence was bolstered by simply logging into Kaggle everyday, and keeping my streak going. Even if all I did was login to Kaggle. I heard someone say on a podcast or Instagram/TikTok video that before they got in shape, all they did was go to the gym and stay there for 5 minutes every day then come back home for 6 weeks. Just that practice solidified their consistency. I’m proud to say that as part of this project, I am on a 70 day Kaggle login streak! Here’s to continuing that streak throughout 2024.\n\n\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post series!"

Instead, it’s offered as individual crawls of varying sizes. The data is extremely popular, cited in over 10,000 papers.\nA key point that will come up again throughout this paper is that CC data is not a representative sample of the internet.

    "section": "CC use in Generative AI",
    "text": "CC use in Generative AI\nOne of the most impactful concepts in this paper was that of infrastructure as contrasted with data.\nMedia studies scholar Luke Munn says:\n\nOne of the things that make infrastructures so powerful is that they model their own ideals. They privilege certain logics and then operationalize them. And in this sense… they both register wider societal values and establish blueprints for how they should be carried out.\n\nCC has an infrastructural role within generative AI R&D: it provides a basis from which AI builders create training datasets. Its data is never used directly, instead, AI builders filter CC data before using it in training.\nCC data is primarily used for pre-training a model, meaning when an architecture is fed data in order to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens. During this phase, we expect the model to store patterns or associations between words in a language (like English) in the sense that given an English word or subword, it can predict the next word or subword that in a grammatically sensible way. For example, if the model is prompted “the bird is” after being pre-trained on sensible data it will likely predict the next word to be “red” or “hungry” or something sensible. This is contrasted with fine-tuning where a model that can generally predict the next token sensibly is then trained on domain-specific data to predict the next token of a particular domain (such as ornithology, the study of birds). So, if a model fine-tuned on ornithological data is prompted “a group of ravens is called” it will hopefully predict the next word as “unkindness.”\n82% of the GPT-3 tokens are from CC. More accurately speaking (see below) 60% of the training data seen by GPT-3 is from CC.\nFrom Brown et al. 2020:\n\nMore boradly speaking, of the 47 LLM papers between 2019-2023 reviewed by Stefan and Mozilla Insights, 64% used filtered CC data. The top 5-most used filtered datasets were:\n\nPile-CC (EletheurAI)\nC4 (Alphabet)\nCustom CC (meaning the AI builders filtered the data themselves)\nCCNet (Facebook)\nRealNews (UW)"

I started to think about creating a neutral data company…that wants to democratize access to information to provide data to other companies\n\nIts guiding principle is that less curation of the provided data enables more research and innovation by downstream users.\nThe authors revisit this mission later on when discussing the relationship between CC and trustworthy AI."

    "section": "CC’s Data",
    "text": "CC’s Data\n\nOverview\nCC aims to support “machine scale analysis” which means automated, large-scale analysis of web data across web domains, as opposed to human scale analysis where a person (or many people) ingests information with their senses and then processes and analyzes it with their brain.\nHow does CC pick which parts of the internet to crawl? CC data consists of samples of URLs from web domains sampled from the CrawlDB, which stores 25+ billion URLs (as well as a score for each URL, when it was last fetches, whether it was successfully crawled and other fields).\nCC contains three types of data (see this site for examples) - WARC (WebARChive) files which store the raw crawl data (HTML code) - WAT (Web Archive Transformation) files which store computed metadata for the data stored in the WARC - WET (WARC Encapsulated Text) files which store extracted plaintext from the data stored in the WARC\nThe CC crawling process is designed to automatically find (a pre-defined maximum number of) new URLs considered good quality CC thinks of “quality” in terms of how CC’s data represents the web as a whole as well as the quality of the URLs included in the crawls.\nThe uncertainty of CC about how their data reflects the web as a whole is due to not knowing the size of the web as a whole. As one of CC’s staff put it:\n\nthe web is practically infinite.\n\nEarlier they mentioned that 3 to 5 billion URLs are added each month. Why not more? Because there is a tradeoff between the size of a crawl and the quality of the crawl. To expand the size of the crawl they have to include lower quality URLs, and many lower quality URLs are spam. Crawlers can get stuck in “crawler traps” which are these pockets of the internet where spam URLs are directed to one another. If a crawler gets stuck in there, potentially a majority of the crawled URLs can be spam, and the crawl data contains spammy content.\nHere’s a screenshot of information of a CC main crawl (1 TiB = 2^40 bytes, around 1100 GB):\nHere is a list of all their main crawls.\n\n\n\nCrawlDB\nURLs are added to CrawlDB during main crawls, discovery crawls (crawls with the sole purpose of fetching more URLs), and sitemap analyses.\n\na Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in the site)\n\n\n\nHarmonic Centrality Score\nHow are URLs scored? and thereby sampled to include in the next crawl? With the Harmonic Centrality Score.\nThe Harmonic Centrality Score measures the importance of a node in a network based on its distance all other nodes. - Shorter distance = higher score. - More direct and indirect links to a domain = higher score. - Captures how accessible a domain is to other web pages.\n“High quality” implies a higher Harmonic Centrality Score. The score for a URL is increased if the URL has never been crawled before or hasn’t been crawled in awhile."

    "text": "Filtering CC for AI\nAs mentioned earlier, AI builders filter CC data before using it to pre-train their models. This section goes into more detail around filtering.\n\nTypes of filtering\n\nBy language (most of CC data is in English)\nKeywords or simple heuristics (only keep lines that end in a punctuation mark, or remove documents with certain keywords)\n\nThe List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words used for C4 dataset is problematic because the words included in that list are not inherently “bad” or “harmful”. It depends on context. For example, here are some words included in this list of “bad words” that are not “bad” given a particular context:\n\n“domination” (filtering out webpages that have the word “domination” will exclude pages with a discussion about domination of one group or system on another)\n“sexuality” and similar terms are of course normal and healthy words to use in many contexts.\nanatomical words (“penis”, “vagina”, “clitoris”, “vulva”) are all perfectly “good” words in many contexts. Furthermore, the censorship of female sexuality is perpetuated by the inclusion of those words in this “bad word” list.\nslurs reclaimed by racial and gender/sex minorities are used in non-derogatory ways in their communities and cultures—exluding these words excludes their representation in the data.\n\n\nAI classifiers (only keeps documents statistically similar to reference dataset)\n\nPile-CC (EletheurAI) uses an AI classifier trained on OpenWebText2 (deduplicated Reddit comments with 3+ upvotes). Most Reddit users are male and white so this is not a representative dataset of the global population. Reddit has also struggled moderating toxicity.\nGPT-3 is pre-trained on CC filtered by using a classifier trained on WebText as a proxy for “high-quality” documents. Documents that are similar to WebText are deemed “low quality”.\n\nDeduplication (remove one document if it is exactly he same or similar to another—“similar” in a statistical sense)\n\nGPT-3 is pre-trained on CC data that was filtered to remove documents with high overlap with other documents (fuzzy deduplication).\n\n\n\n\n(In)adequacy of Filtering Methods\nThere is a fundamental unresolved conflict or dilemma: the amount of data desired is too large for manual curation but automated filtering for toxicity and bias are significantly limited. The authors discuss solutions to this later on."

    "text": "CC and Trustworthy AI\nMozilla defines Trustworthy AI is AI that is:\n\ndemonstrably worthy of trust, tech that considers accountability, agency, and individual and collective well-being…[trustworthy] AI-driven products and services are designed with human agency and accountability from the beginning\n\nWhat stood out to me from this definition were the terms accountability, agency and well-being.\n\nUpside of CC\nThe filtered CC versions used in LLM training are inherently more auditable than any proprietary training datasets because CC data is freely accessible online.\nLLMs open and transparent about their data typically come from outside of Big Tech (e.g., Bloom), achieving CC’s mission of making this data accessible to small startups and individuals.\n\n\nDownsides of CC\nWhile filtered CC data is more auditable than proprietary datasets, AI builders don’t necessarily take the opportunity to be transparent about their CC use. In other words, what use is this auditability if how this freely accessible data is filtered is not disclosed?\nThe size and diversity of CC makes it hard to understand what an LLM is trained on. This is reinforced by the (false) assumption among some AI builders that CC represents the “entire internet” and somehow is a proxy for representing “all human knowledge”. CC staff explicitly state:\n\nOften it is claimed that Common Crawl contains the entire web, but that’s absolutely not true. Based on what I know about how many URLs exist, it’s very, very small.\n\nTraining of generative AI on massive amounts of copyrighted material could trend towards making the internet less open and collaborative (“data revolts”: when content platforms block crawlers to protect their data). Note that CC stays within the bounds of US fair use policy for copyrighted materials. It only copies HTML code, no images or media or full copies of domains.\n\nHere’s an example of how content platforms block crawlers, from NY Times’ robot.txt:\nUser-agent: CCBot\nDisallow: /\n\n\nRecommendations for using CC to train AI\n\nPut more effort into filtering CC. Filter more types of problematic content (e.g., content that is racist or mysoginist).\nProblematic content should be annotated (if it’s not filtered out). There are some models who are trained on problematic content in order to better detect it. These models will need to be trained on problematic data.\nConsistently provide proper dataset documentation. (See “Dataset Audit Card” example on page 7 of Large Datasets: A Pyrrhic Win for Computer Vision?)\n\n\n\nRecommendations for LLM-based end-user products\n\nBetter industry standards and government regulation for evaluating filtered CC versions and downstream model effects.\nMore nuanced, culturally contextual tools to evaluate profanity, racism, discrimination, etc. found in the datasets.\nA descriptive demographic overview of the dataset content (e.g., what region and culture does this data represent?)\nEvaluations by human moderators under fair, safe conditions (‘It’s destroyed me completely’: Kenyan moderators decry toll of training of AI models).\nEvaluating the effects of individual datasets on model behavior (like EletheurAI’s Language Model Evaluation Harness).\nTrustworthy intermediaries who filter CC for various purposes (e.g., subject matter experts or cultural experts who can curate data to match their subject or culture appropriately)."

    "text": "The Future of CC\n\nCC’s Shortcomings\n\nCC is not a “neutral data” organization as its samples are not representative of the web and because the web is not representative of all people (about 40% or 3 billion people in the world do not have internet access). I would go further and say that there is no such thing as neutral data, even raw data is not neutral because data collection, and the environment within which data is collected is not neutral.\nCC’s lack of transparency (around its data governance) is at odds with its self-image as a public resource. For a long time, there was almost no public communication from CC outside of its mailing list (which mostly dealt with technical questions) and its blog (mostly dedicated to announcing new crawl data).\n\n\n\nRecommendations for CC\n\nAdd a Terms of Use to the data. If AI builders want to use your data, they should have to document their filtering methodology, and take approaches to better filter (or annotate) their data for problematic, biased and harmful content.\nCC should conduct more curated, values-oriented crawls so that digitally marginalized communities are more included. Since a URL’s quality is determined by its Harmonic Centrality Score, and since that score is determined by how accessible the URL is to other URLs, URLs from communities without socioeconomic power and/or resources will not be deemed “accessible” as such and will be scored low. Additionally, many communities will post popular links to Facebook, but because it doesn’t allow crawlers, CC won’t get to see that URL.\nAdd a community-driven approach to identify relevant content for crawls. Let the people themselves tell you directly what content matters to them and represents their interests and cultures.\nProvide quality and toxicity evaluations, or language labeling.\nCreate a formal way to make requests about crawls.\nProvide educational resources about the limitations of CC data.\nFoster discussions of filtering and data analysis tools.\nIncrease the number and diversity of high-quality datasets curated by humans equitably. In other words, it’s okay if these datasets are small if they are high quality and there are a lot of them.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI really enjoyed this paper. I came away from it inspired and empowered. If we can put our heads together and expand the filtered CC data space to include more intentional and representative data about cultures, topics and ideologies that are either ignored or filtered out in the most popular datasets today, we can reshape how LLMs predict the next token.\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nAlmost every time I code something, I keep at the forefront of my mind the saying “make it work, make it right, make it fast” by Kent Beck. After this competition, I feel I landed somewhere between making it work and making it right. What is “right” when it comes to a competition? Well, at this stage of my machine learning journey, I would like to rank in the top 50% in the final Leaderboard. I was in the top 87% during the live competition, and in the top 65% post-competition, so I’m moving in the right direction.\nI also want to take all of my learnings with a grain of salt. This was one (relatively small) dataset that certainly had its own problems (as I detailed in my live competition notebook) with one (relatively small) test set. Just because my neural net didn’t perform very well doesn’t indict all neural nets. Similarly, just because my single Random Forests performed well, doesn’t mean they always will. Also, just because the textbook’s Chapter 9 approach to tabular prediction didn’t result in a top Kaggle competition Private score, doesn’t mean it’s not immensibly valuable to data science in production.\nAt the end of this year, after hopefully competing in at least a couple more live competitions, I will look back at this experience as a necessary but insufficient step towards having good intuition about machine learning.\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition. I’m excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\nIn this blog post series, I’ll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way. My last two blog posts in this series reference Jeremy’s Scaling Up: Road to the Top, Part 3 notebook to improve my large model ensemble predictions.

RISE turnes your notebook into a presentation.\nGenerally speaking, if it’s something that a human can do reasonably quickly, even an expert human (like look at a Go board and decide if it’s a good board or not) then that’s probably something that deep learning will probably be good at. If it’s something that takes logical thought process over time, particularly if it’s not based on much data, deep learning probably won’t do that well.\nThe first neural network was built in 1957. The basic ideas have not changed much at all.\nWhat’s going on in these models?\n\nArthur Samuel in late 1950s invented Machine Learning.\nNormal program: input -&gt; program -&gt; results.\nMachine Learning model: input and weights (parameters) -&gt; model -&gt; results.\n\nThe model is a mathematical function that takes the input, multiplies them with one set of weights and adds them up, then does that again for a second set of weights, and so forth.\nIt takes all of the negative numbers and replaces them with 0.\nIt takes all those numbers as inputs to the next layer.\nAnd it repeats a few times.\n\nWeights start out as being random.\nA more useful workflow: input/weights -&gt; model -&gt; results -&gt; loss -&gt; update weights.\nThe loss is a number that says how good the results were.\nWe need a way to come up with a new set of weights that are a bit better than the current weights.\n“bit better” weights means it makes the loss a bit better.\nIf we make it a little bit better a few times, it’ll eventually get good.\nNeural nets proven to solve any computable function (i.e. it’s flexible enough to update weights until the results are good).\n“Generate artwork based on someone’s twitter bio” is a computable function.\nOnce we’ve finished the training procedure we don’t the loss and the weights can be integrated into the model.\nWe end up with inputs -&gt; model -&gt; results which looks like our original idea of a program.\nDeploying a model will have lots of tricky details but there will be one line of code which says learn.predict which takes an input and provides results.\nThe most important thing to do is experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Your Deep Learning Journey In this section, I’ll take notes while I read Chapter 1 in the textbook.\n\n\n\nWhat you don’t need for deep learning: lots of math, lots of data, lots of expensive computers.\nDeep learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data by using multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to perform a specified task.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts developed a mathematical model of an artificial neuron in 1943.\nMost of Pitt’s famous work was done while he was homeless.\nPsychologist Frank Rosenblatt further developed the artificial neuron to give it the ability to learn and built the first device that used these principles, the Mark I Perceptron, which was able to recognize simple shapes.\nMarvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book about the Perceptron and showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow the limitations of a single layer to be addressed.\nThe 1986 book Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) by David Rumelhart, James McClelland, and the PDP Research Group defined PDP as requiring the following:\n\nA set of processing units.\nA state of activation.\nAn output function for each unit.\nA pattern of connectivity among units.\nA propogation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities.\nAn activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit.\nA learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience.\nAn environment within which the system must operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of deep learning is artisanal: how do you know if you’ve got enough data, whether it is in the right format, if your model is training properly, and, if it’s not, what you should do about it?\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'\n\ndef is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\n    path,\n    get_image_files(path),\n    valid_pct=0.2,\n    seed=42,\n    label_func=is_cat,\n    item_tfms=Resize(224)\n)\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [811712512/811706944 00:11&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(1)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/fastai/vision/learner.py:288: UserWarning: `cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\n  warn(\"`cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\")\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future.

His basic idea was this: instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples of the problem to solve, and let it figure out how to solve it itself.\nIn 1961 his checkers-playing program had learned so much that it beat the Connecticut state champion.\nWeights are just variables and a weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables.\nThe program’s inputs are values that it processes in order to produce its results (for instance, taking image pixels as inputs, and returning the classification “dog” as a result).\nBecause the weights affect the program, they are in a sense another kind of input.\nA program using weight assignment: inputs and weights -&gt; model -&gt; results.\nA model is a special kind of program, on that can do many different things depending on the weights.\nWeights = parameters, with the term “weights” reserved for a particulat type of model parameter.\nLearning would become entirely automatic when the adjustment of the weights was also automatic.\nTraining a maching learning model: inputs and weights -&gt; model -&gt; results -&gt; performance -&gt; update weights.\nresults are different than the performance of a model.\nUsing a trained model as a program -&gt; inputs -&gt; model -&gt; results.\nmaching learning is the training of programs developed by allowing a computer to learn from its experience, rather than through manually coding the individual steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeural networks is a mathematical function that can solve any problem to any level of accuracy.\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a completely general way to update the weights of a neural network, to make it improve at any given task.\nImage classification problem:\n\nOur inputs are the images.\nOur weights are the weights in the neural net.\nOur model is a neural net.\nOur results are the values that are calculated by the neural net, like “dog” or “cat”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functional form of the model is called its architecture.\nThe weights are called parameters.\nThe predictions are calculated from the independent variable, which is the data not including the labels.\nThe results or the model are called predictions.\nThe measure of performance is called the loss.\nThe loss depends not only on the predictions, but also on the correct labels (also known as targets or the dependent variable).\nDetailed training loop: inputs and parameters -&gt; architecture -&gt; predictions (+ labels) -&gt; loss -&gt; update parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nA model cannot be created without data.\nA model can learn to operate on only the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\nThis learning approach creates only predictions, not recommended actions.\nIt’s not enough to just have examples of input data, we need labels for that data too.\nPositive feedback loop: the more the model is used, the more biased the data becomes, making the model even more biased, and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_tfms are applied to each item while batch_tfms are applied to a batch of items at a time using the GPU.\nA classification model attempts to predict a class, or category.\nA regression model is one that attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as temperature or location.\nThe parameter seed=42 sets the random seed to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it. This way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\nWe care about how well our model works on previously unseen images.\nThe longer you train for, the better your accuracy will get on the training set; the validation set accuracy will also improve for a while, but eventually it will start getting worse as the model starts to memorize the training set rather than finding generalizable underlying patterns in the data. When this happens, we say that the model is overfitting.\nOverfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training for all machine learning practitioners, and all algorithms.\nYou should only use methods to avoid overfitting after you have confirmed that overfitting is occurring (i.e., if you have observed the validation accuracy getting worse during training)\nfastai defaults to valid_pct=0.2.\nModels using architectures with more layers take longer to train and are more prone to overfitting, on the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\nA metric is a function that measures the quality of the model’s predictions using the validation set.\nerror_rate tells you what percentage of inputs in the validation set are being classified incorrectly.\naccuracy = 1.0 - error_rate.\nThe entire purpose of loss is to define a “measure of performance” that the training system can use to update weights automatically. A good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand.\nA model that has weights that have already been trained on another dataset is called a pretrained model.\nWhen using a pretrained model, cnn_learner will remove the last layer and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights. This last part of the model is known as the head.\nUsing a pretrained model for a task different from what is was originally trained for is known as transfer learning.\nThe architecture only describes a template for a mathematical function; it doesn’t actually do anything until we provide values for the millions of parameters it contains.\nTo fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of epochs).\nfit will fit a model (i.e., look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels).\nFine-Tuning: a transfer learning technique that updates the parameters of a pretrained model by training for additional epochs using a different task from that used for pretraining.\nfine_tune has a few parameters you can set, but in the default form it does two steps:\n\nUse one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to get the new random head to work correctly with your dataset.\nUse the number of epochs requested when calling the method to fit the entire model, updating the weights of the later layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers (which don’t require many changes from the pretrained weights).\n\nThe head of the model is the part that is newly added to be specific to the new dataset.\nAn epoch is one complete pass through the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we fine tune our pretrained models, we adapt what the last layers focus on to specialize on the problem at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of things can be represented as images.\nSound can be converted to a spectogram.\nTimes series data can be created into an image using Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF).\nIf the human eye can recognize categories from the images, then a deep learning model should be able to do so too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nLabel\nThe data that we’re trying to predict\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe template of the model that we’re trying to fit; i.e., the actual mathematical function that we’re passing the input data and parameters to\n\n\nModel\nThe combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters\n\n\nParameters\nThe values in the model that change what task it can do and that are updated through model training\n\n\nFit\nUpdate the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels\n\n\nTrain\nA synonym for fit\n\n\nPretrained Model\nA model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned\n\n\nFine-tune\nUpdate a pretrained model for a different task\n\n\nEpoch\nOne complete pass through the input data\n\n\nLoss\nA measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via SGD\n\n\nMetric\nA measurement of how good the model is using the validation set, chosen for human consumption\n\n\nValidation set\nA set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is\n\n\nTraining set\nThe data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set\n\n\nOverfitting\nTraining a model in such a way that it remembers specific features of the input data, rather than generalizing wel to data not seen during training\n\n\nCNN\nConvolutional neural network; a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation\nNatural language processing (see below)\nTabular (see Adults income classification above)\nCollaborative filtering (see MovieLens ratings predictor above)\nStart by using one of the cut-down dataset versions and later scale up to the full-size version. This is how the world’s top practitioners do their modeling in practice; they do most of their experimentation and prototyping with subsets of their data, and use the full dataset only when they have a good understanding of what they have to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the model makes an accurate prediction for a data item, that should be because it has learned characteristics of that kind of item, and not because the model has been shaped by actually having seen that particular item.\nHyperparameters: various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors.\nWe, as modelers, are evaluating the model by looking at predictions on the validation data when we decide to explore new hyperparameter values and we are in danger of overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.\nThe test set can be used only to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts.\nTraining data is fully exposed to training and modeling processes, validation data is less exposed and test data is fully hidden.\nThe test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy.\nThe discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest.\nIt’s a good idea for you to try out a simple baseline model yourself, so you know what a really simply model can achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key property of the validation and test sets is that they must be representative of the new data you will see in the future.\nAs an example, for time series data, use earlier dates for training set and later more recent dates as validation set\nThe data you will be making predictions for in production may be qualitatively different from the data you have to train your model with.\n\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\n\n# I'm using IMDB_SAMPLE instead of the full IMDB dataset since it either takes too long or\n# I get a CUDA Out of Memory error if the batch size is more than 16 for the full dataset\n# Using a batch size of 16 with the sample dataset works fast\ndls = TextDataLoaders.from_csv(\n    path=untar_data(URLs.IMDB_SAMPLE),\n    csv_fname='texts.csv',\n    text_col=1,\n    label_col=0,\n    bs=16)\n\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\ncategory\n\n\n\n\n0\nxxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \\n\\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is\nnegative\n\n\n1\nxxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel -

What happens?\n\nDepending on the server, it may take some time for the output to generate, but running this cell will output 2.\n\nFollow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.\n\n(I did this for the notebook shared for Lesson 1).\n\nComplete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.\n\nDone. Will reference some of it again.\n\nWhy is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?\n\nBecause it’s hard to instruct a computer clear instructions to recognize images.\n\nWhat did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”?\n\nA particular choice for weights (variables)\n\nWhat term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”?\n\nParameters\n\nDraw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model\n\ninput and weights -&gt; model -&gt; results -&gt; performance -&gt; update weights/inputs\n\nWhy is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n\nBecause a deep learning model has many layers and connectivities and activations between neurons that are not intuitive to our understanding.\n\nWhat is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n\nUniversal approximation theorem.\n\nWhat do you need in order to train a model?\n\nLabeled data (Inputs and targets).\nArchitecture.\nInitial weights.\nA measure of performance (loss, accuracy).\nA way to update the model (SGD).\n\nHow could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?\n\nThe model will end up predicting where arrests are made, not where crime is taking place, so more police officers will go to locations where more arrests are predicted and feed that data back to the model which will reinforce the prediction of arrests in those areas, continuing this feedback loop of predictions -&gt; arrests -&gt; predictions.\n\nDo we always have to use 224x224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?\n\nNo, that’s just the convention for image recognition models.\nYou can use larger images but it will slow down the training process (it takes longer to open up bigger images).\n\nWhat is the difference between classification and regression?\n\nClassification predicts discrete classes or categories.\nRegression predicts continuous values.\n\nWhat is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n\nA validation set is a dataset upon which a model’s accuracy (or metrics in general) is calculated during training, as well as the dataset upon which the performance of different hyperparameters (like batch size and learning rate) are measured.\nA test set is a dataset upon which a model’s final performance is measured, a truly unseen dataset for both the model and the practitioner\n\nWhat will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set?\n\nSet aside a random 20% of the data as the validation set by default\n\nCan we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n\nNo, in situations where we want to ensure that the model’s accuracy is evaluated on data the model has not seen, we should not use a random validation set. Instead, we should create an intentional validation set. For example:\n\nFor time series data, use the most recent dates as the validation set\nFor human recognition data, use images of different people for training and validation sets\n\n\nWhat is overfitting? Provide an example.\n\nOverfitting is when a model memorizes features of the training dataset instead of learning generalizations of the features in the data. An example of this is when a model memorizes training data facial features but then cannot recognize different faces in the real world. Another example is when a model memorizes the handwritten digits in the training data, so it cannot then recognize digits written in different handwriting. Overfitting can be observed during training when the validation loss starts to increase as the training loss decreases.\n\nWhat is a metric? How does it differ from loss?\n\nA metric a measurement of how good a model is performing, chosen for human consumption. A loss is also a measurement of how good a model is performing, but it’s chosen to drive training using an optimizer.\n\nHow can pretrained models help?\n\nPretrained models are already good at recognizing many generalized features and so they can help by providing a set of weights in an architecture that are capable, reducing the amount of time you need to train a model specific to your task.\n\nWhat is the “head” of the model?\n\nThe last/top few neural network layers which are replaced with randomized weights in order to specialize your model via training on the task at hand (and not the task it was pretrained to perform).\n\nWhat kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?\n\nEarly layers: simple features lie lines, color gradients\nLater layers: compelx features like dog faces, outlines of people\n\nAre image models useful only for photos?\n\nNo! Lots of things can be represented by images so if you can represent something (like a sound) as an image (spectogram) and differences between classes/categories are easily recognizable by the human eye, you can train an image classifier to recognize it.\n\nWhat is an architecture?\n\nA template, mathematical function, to which you pass input data to in order to fit/train a model\n\nWhat is segmentation?\n\nRecognizing different objects in an image based on pixel colors (each object is a different pixel color)\n\nWhat is y_range used for? When do we need it?\n\nIt’s used to specify the output range of a regression model. We need it when the target is a continuous value.\n\nWhat are hyperparameters?\n\nModeling choices such as network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies and other higher level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters.\n\nWhat is the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?\n\nMaking sure you have good validation and test sets to evaluate the performance of a model on real world data.\nTrying out a simple baseline model to know what level of performance such a model can achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a GPU useful for deep learning? How is a CPU different, and why is it less effective for deep learning?\n\nCPU vs GPU for Machine Learning\n\nCPUs process tasks in a sequential manner, GPUs process tasks in parallel.\nGPUs can have thousands of cores, processing tasks at the same time.\nGPUs have many cores processing at low speeds, CPUs have few cores processing at high speeds.\nSome algorithms are optimized for CPUs rather than GPUs (time series data, recommendation systems that need lots of memory).\nNeural networks are designed to process tasks in parallel.\n\nCPU vs GPU in Machine Learning Algorithms: Which is Better?\n\nMachine Learning Operations Preferred on CPUs\n\nRecommendation systems that involve huge memory for embedding layers.\nSupport vector machines, time-series data, algorithms that don’t require parallel computing.\nRecurrent neural networks because they use sequential data.\nAlgorithms with intensive branching.\n\nMachine Learning Operations Preferred on GPUs\n\nOperations that involve parallelism.\n\n\nWhy Deep Learning Uses GPUs\n\nNeural networks are specifically made for running in parallel.\n\n\nTry to think of three areas where feedback loops might impact the use of machine learning. See if you can find documented examples of that happening in practice.\n\nHidden Risks of Machine Learning Applied to Healthcare: Unintended Feedback Loops Between Models and Future Data Causing Model Degradation\n\nIf clinicians fully trust the machine learning model (100% adoption of the predicted label) the false positive rate (FPR) grows uncontrollably with the number of updates.\n\nRunaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing\n\nOnce police are deployed based on these predictions, data from observations in the neighborhood is then used to further update the model.\nDiscovered crime data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process is repeated.\nPredictive policing systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.\n\nPitfalls of Predictive Policing: An Ethical Analysis\n\nPredictive policing relies on a large database of previous crime data and forecasts where crime is likely to occur. Since the program relies on old data, those previous arrests need to be unbiased to generate unbiased forecasts.\nPeople of color are arrested far more often than white people for committing the same crime.\nRacially biased arrest data creates biased forecasts in neighborhoods where more people of color are arrested.\nIf the predictive policing algorithm is using biased data to divert more police forces towards less affluent neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color, then those neighborhoods are not receiving the same treatment as others.\n\nBias in Criminal Risk Scores Is Mathematically Inevitable, Researchers Say\n\nThe algorithm COMPAS which predicts whether a person is “high-risk” and deemed more likely to be arrested in the future, leads to being imprisoned (instead of sent to rehab) or longer sentences.\n\nCan bots discriminate? It’s a big question as companies use AI for hiring\n\nIf an older candidate makes it past the resume screening process but gets confused by or interacts poorly with the chatbot, that data could teach the algorithm that candidates with similar profiles should be ranked lower\n\nEcho chambers, rabbit holes, and ideological bias: How YouTube recommends content to real users\n\nWe find that YouTube’s algorithm pushes real users into (very) mild ideological echo chambers.\nWe found that 14 out of 527 (~3%) of our users ended up in rabbit holes.\nFinally, we found that, regardless of the ideology of the study participant, the algorithm pushes all users in a moderately conservative direction."

constraints and overestimating the capabilities of deep learning may lead to frustratingly poor results, at least until you gain some experience and can solve the problems that arise.\nOverstimating the constraints and underestimating the capabilities of deep learning may mean you do not attempt a solvable problem because you talk yourself out of it.\nThe most important thing (as you learn deep learning) is to ensure that you have a project to work on.\nThe goal is not to find the “perfect” dataset or project, but just to get started and iterate from there.\nComplete every step as well as you can in a reasonable amount of time, all the way to the end.\nComputer vision\n\nObject recognition: recognize items in an image\nObject detection: recognition + highlight the location and name of each found object.\nDeep learning algorithms are generally not good at recognizing images that are significantly different in structure or style from those used to train the model.\n\nNLP\n\nDeep learning is not good at generating correct responses.\nText generation models will always be technologically a bit ahead of models for recognizing automatically generated text.\nGoogle’s online translation system is based on deep learning.\n\nCombining text and images\n\nA deep learning model can be trained on input images with output captions written in English, and can learn to generate surprisingly appropriate captions automatically for new images (with no guarantee the captions will be correct).\nDeep learning should be used not as an entirely automated process, but as part of a process in which the model and a human user interact closely.\n\nTabular data\n\nIf you already have a system that is using random forests or gradient boosting machines then switching to or adding deep learning may not result in any dramatic improvement.\nDeep learning greatly increases the variety of columns that you can include.\nDeep learning models generally take longer to train than random forests or gradient boosting machines.\n\nRecommendation systems\n\nA special type of tabular data (a high-cardinality categorical variable representing users and another one representing products or something similar).\nDeep learning models are good at handling high cardinality categorical variables and thus recommendation systems.\nDeep learning models do well when combining these variables with other kinds of data such as natural language, images, or additional metadata represented as tables such as user information, previous transactions, and so forth.\nNearly all machine learning approaches have th downside that they tell you only which products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations would be helpful for a user.\n\nOther data types\n\nUsing NLP deep learning methods is the current SOTA approach for many types of protein analysis since protein chains look a lot like natural language documents.\n\nThe Drivetrain Approach\n\nDefined objective\nLevers (what inputs can we control)\nData (what inputs we can collect)\nModels (how the levers influence the objective)\n\nGathering data\n\nFor most projects you can find the data online.\nUse duckduckgo_search\n\nFrom Data to DataLoaders\n\nDataLoaders is a thin class that just stores whatever DataLoader objects you pass to it and makes them available as train and valid.\nTo turn data into a DataLoaders object we need to tell fastai four things:\n\nWhat kinds of data we are working with.\nHow to get the list of items.\nHow to label these items.\nHow to create the validation set.\n\nWith the DataBlock API you can customize every stage of the creation of your DataLoaders:\n\n\nbears = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=Resize(128))\n\nexplanation of DataBlock\n\nblocks specifies types for independent (the thing we are using to make predictions from) and dependent (our target) variables.\nComputers don’t really know how to create random numbers at all, but simply create lists of numbers that look random; if you provide the same starting point for that list each time–called the seed–then you will get the exact same list each time.\nImages need to be all the same size.\nA DataLoader is a class that provides batches of a few items at a time to the GPU.\nfastai default batch size is 64 items.\nResize crops the images to fit a square shape, alternatively you can pad (ResizeMethod.Pad) or squish (ResizeMethod.Squish) the images to fit the square.\nSquishing (model learns that things look differently from how they actually are), cropping (removal of features that would allow us to perform recognition) and padding (lot of empty space which is just wasted computation) are wasteful or problematic approaches. Instead, randomly select part of the image and then crop to just that part. On each epoch, we randomly select a different part of each image (RandomResizedCrop(min_scale)).\nTraining the neural network with examples of images in which objects are in slightly different places and are slightly different sizes helps it to understand the basic concept of what an object is and how it can be represented in an image.\n\nData Augmentation\n\nrefers to creating random variations of our input data, such that they appear different but do not change the meaning of the data (rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes, and contrast changes).\naug_transforms() provides a standard set of augmentations.\nUse batch_tfms to process a batch at a time on the GPU to save time.\n\nTraining your model and using it to clean your data\n\nView confusion matrix with ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn). The diagonal shows images that are classified correctly. Calculated using validation set.\nSort images by loss using interp.plot_top_losses().\nLoss is high if the model is incorrect (especially if it’s also confident) or if it’s correct but not confident.\nA model can help you find data issues more quickly.\n\nUsing the model for inference\n\nlearn.export() will export a .pkl file.\nGet predictions with learn_inf.predict(&lt;input&gt;). This returns three things: the predicted category in the same format you originally provided, the index of the predicted category and the probabilities for each category.\nYou can access the DataLoaders as an attribute of the Learner: learn_inf.dls.\n\nDeploying your app\n\nYou almost certainly do not need a GPU to serve your model in production.\nTo classify a few users’ images at a time, you need high-volume. If you do have this scenario, use Microsoft’s ONNX Runtime or AWS SageMaker.\nRecommended wherever possible to deploy the model itself to a server and have your mobile/edge application connect to it as a web service.\nIf your application uses sensitive data, your users may be concerned about an approach that sends that data to a remote server.\n\nHow to Avoid Disaster\n\nUnderstanding and testing the behavior of a deep learning model is much more difficult than with most other code you write.\nThe kinds of photos that people are most likely to upload to the internet are the kinds of photos that do a good job of clearly and artistically displaying their subject matter, which isn’t the kind of input this system is going to be getting in real life. We may need to do a lot of our own data collection and labeling to create a useful system.\nout-of-domain data: data that our model sees in production that is very different from what it saw during training.\ndomain shift: data that our model sees changes over time.\nDeployment process\n\nManual Process: run model in parallel, humans check all predictions.\nLimited scope deployment: careful human supervision, time or geography limited.\nGradual expansion: good reporting systems needed, consider what could go wrong.\n\nUnforeseen consequences and feedback loops\n\nYour model may change the behavior of the system it’s a part of.\nfeedback loops can result in negative implications of bias getting worse.\nA helpful exercise prior to rolling out a significant machine learning system is to consider the question “What would happen if it went really, really well?”\n\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nWhere do text models currently have a major deficiency?\n\nProviding correct or accurate information.\n\nWhat are possible negative societal implications of text generation models?\n\nThe viral spread of misinformation, which can lead to real actions and harms.\n\nIn situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a god alternative to automating a process?\n\nRun the model in parallel with a human checking its predictions.\n\nWhat kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at?\n\nHigh-cardinality categorical data.\n\nWhat’s a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems?\n\nIt will only tell you which products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations may be helpful for a user.\n\nWhat are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach?\n\nDefine an objective\nDetermine what inputs (levers) you can control\nCollect data\nCreate models (how the levers influence the objective)\n\nHow do the steps of the Drivetrain Approach map to a recommendation system?\n\nObjective: drive additional sales due to recommendations.\nLevel: ranking of the recommendations.\nData: must be collectd to generate recommendations that will cause new sales.\nModels: two for purchasing probabilities conditional on seeing or not seeing a recommendation, the difference between these two probabilities is a utility function for a given recommendation to a customer (low in cases when algorithm recommends a familiar book that the customer has already rejected, or a book they would have bought even without the recommendation).\n\nCreate an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy it on the web.\n\nHere.\n\nWhat is DataLoaders?\n\nA class that creates validation and training sets/batches that are fed to the GPUS\n\nWhat four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders?\n\nWhat kinds of data we are working with (independent and dependent variables).\nHow to get the list of items.\nHow to label these items.\nHow to create the validation set.\n\nWhat does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do?\n\nSet aside a percentage of the data as the validation set.\n\nHow do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set?\n\nSet the seed parameter to the same value.\n\nWhat letters are often used to signify the independent and dependent variables?\n\nIndependent: x\nDependent: y\n\nWhat’s the difference between crop, pad and squish resize approaches? When might you choose one over the others?\n\nCrop: takes a section of the image and resizes it to the desired size. Use when it’s not necessary to have the model traing on the whole image.\nPad: keep the image aspect ratio as is, add white/black padding to make a square. Use when it’s necessary to have the model train on the whole image.\nSquish: distorts the image to fit a square. Use when it’s not necessary to have the model train on the original aspect ratio.\n\nWhat is data augmentation? Why is it needed?\n\nData augmentation is the creation of random variations of input data through techniques like rotation, flipping, brightness changes, contrast changes, perspective warping. It is needed to help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting/perspective conditions.\n\nProvide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data.\nWhat is the difference between item_tfms and batch_tfms?\n\nitem_tfms are transforms that are applied to each item in the set.\nbatch_tfms are transforms applied to a batch of items in the set.\n\nWhat is a confusion matrix?\n\nA matrix that shows the counts of predicted (columns) vs. actual (rows) labels, with the diagonal being correctly predicted data.\n\nWhat does export save?\n\nBoth the architecture and the parameters as a .pkl file.\n\nWhat is called when we use a model for making predictions, instead of training?\n\nInference\n\nWhat are IPython widgets?\n\ninteractive browser controls for Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nWhen would you use a CPU for deployment? When might a GPU be better?\n\nCPU: low-volume, single-user inputs for prediction.\nGPU: high-volume, multiple-user inputs for predictions.\n\nWhat are the downsides of deploying your app to a server, instead of to a client (or edge) device such as a phone or PC?\n\nRequires internet connectivity (and latency).\nSensitive data transfer may not be okay with your users.\nManaging complexity and scaling the server creates additional overhead.\n\nWhat are three examples of problems that could occur when rolling out a bear warning system in practice?\n\nout-of-domain data: the images captured of real bears may not be represented in the model’s training or validation datasets.\nNumber of bear alerts doubles or halves after rollout of the new system in some location.\nout-of-domain data: the cameras may capture low-resolution images of the bears when the training and validation set had high resolution images.\n\nWhat is out-of-domain data?\n\nData your model sees in production that it hasn’t seen during training.\n\nWhat is domain shift?\n\nChanges in the data that our model sees in production over time.\n\nWhat are the three steps in the deployment process?\n\nManual Process\nLimited scope deployment\nGradual expansion\n\n\nFurther Research\n\nConsider how the Drivetrain Approach maps to a project or problem you’re interested in.\n\nI’ll take the example of a project I will be working on to practice what I’m learning in this book: training a deep learning model which correctly classifies the typeface from a collection of single letter.\n\nThe objective: correctly classify typeface from a collection of single letters.\nLevers: observe key features of key letters that are the “tell” of a typeface.\nData: using an HTML canvas object and Adobe Fonts, generate images of single letters of multiple fonts associated with each category of typeface.\nModels: output the probabilities of each typeface a given collection of single letters is predicted as. This allows for some flexibility in how you categorize letters based on the shared characteristics of more than one typeface that the particular font may possess.\n\n\nWhen might it be best to avoid certain types of data augmentation?\n\nIn my typeface example, it’s best to avoid perspective warping because it will change key features used to recognize a typeface.\n\nFor a project you’re interested in applying deep learning to, consider the thought experiment, “What would happen if it went really, really well?”\n\nIf my typeface classifier works really well, I imagine it would be used by people to take pictures of real-world text and learn what typeface it is. This may inspire a new wave of typeface designers. If a feedback loop was possible, and the classifier went viral, the very definition of typefaces may be affected by popular opinion. Taken a step further, a generative model may be inspired by this classifier, and a new wave of AI typeface would be launched—however this last piece is highly undesirable unless the training of the model involves appropriate licensing and attribution of the typefaces used that are created by humans. Furthermore, from what I understand from reading about typefaces, the process of creating a typeface is an amazing experience and should not be replaced with AI generators. If I created such a generative model (in part 2 of the course) and it went viral (do HuggingFace Spaces go viral? Cuz that’s where I would launch it), I would take it down.\n\nStart a blog (done!)"

We don’t want the derivative of the parameter update, we only want the derivative with respect to the loss.\nAutomate the steps\n\nCalculate Mean Squared Error\nCall .backward.\nSubtract gradient * small number from the parameters\n\nAll optimizers are built on the concept of gradient descent (calculate gradients and decrease the loss).\nWe need a better function than quadratics\nRectified Linear Unit:\n\ndef rectified_linear(m,b,x):\n    y = m*x + b\n    return torch.clip(y, 0.)\n\ntorch.clip turns values less than value specified to the value specified (in this case, it turns negative values to 0.).\nAdding rectified linear functions together gives us an arbitrarily squiggly function that will match as close as we want to the data.\nReLU in 2D gives you surfaces, volumes in 3D, etc.\nWith this incredibly simple foundation you can construct an arbitrarily precise, accurate model.\nWhen you have ReLU’s getting added together, and gradient descent to optimize the parameters, and samples of inputs and outputs that you want, the computer “draws the owl” so to speak.\nDeep learning is using gradient descent to set some parameters to make a wiggly function (the addition of lots of rectified linear units or something very similar to that) that matches your data.\nWhen selecting an architecture, the biggest beginner mistake is that they jump to the highest-accuracy models.\nAt the start of the project, just use resnet18 so you can spend all of your time trying things out (data augmentation, data cleaning, different external data) as fast as possible.\nTrying better architectures is the very last thing to do.\nHow do I know if I have enough data?\n\nVast majority of projects in industry wait far too long until they train their first model.\nTrain your first model on day 1 with whatever CSV files you can hack together.\nSemi-supervised training lets you get dramatically more out of your data.\nOften it’s easy to get lots of inputs but hard to get lots of outputs (labels).\n\nUnits of parameter gradients: for each increase in parameter of 1, the gradient is the amount the loss would change by (if it stayed at that slope—which it doesn’t because it’s a curve).\nOnce you get close enough to the optimal parameter value, all loss functions look like quadratics\n\nThe slope of the loss function decreases as you approach the optimal\n\nLearning rate (a hyperparameter) is multiplied by the gradient, the product of which is subtracted from the parameters\nIf you pick a learning rate that’s too large, you will diverge; if you pick too small, it’ll take too long to train.\nhttp://matrixmultiplication.xyz/\nMatrix multiplication is the critical foundational mathematical operation in deep learning\nGPUs are good at matrix multiplication with tensor cores (multiply together two 4x4 matrices)\nUse a spreadsheet to train a deep learning model on the Kaggle Titanic dataset in which you’re trying to predict if a person survived.\n\nColumns included (convert some of them to binary categorical variables):\n\nSurvivor\nPclass\n\nConvert to Pclass_1 and Pclass_2 (both 1/0).\n\nSex\n\nConvert to Male (0/1) column.\n\nAge\n\nRemove blanks.\nNormalize (Age/Max(Age))\n\nSibSp (how many siblings they have)\nParch (# of parents/children aboard)\nFare\n\nLots of very small and very large fares, log of it has a much more even distribution. (LOG10(Fare + 1).\n\nEmbarked (which city they got on at)\n\nRemove blanks.\nConvert to Embark_S and Embark_C (both 1/0)\n\nOnes\n\nAdd a column of 1s.\n\n\nCreate random numbers for params (including Const) with =RAND() - 0.5.\nRegression\n\nUse SUMPRODUCT to calculate linear function.\nLoss of linear function is (linear function result - Survived) ^ 2.\nAverage loss = AVERAGE(individual losses).\nUser “Solver” with GRG Nonlinear Solving Method. Set Objective to minimize the cell with average loss. Change parameter variables.\n\nNeural Net\n\nTwo sets of params.\nTwo linear columns.\nTwo ReLU columns.\nAdding two linear functions together gives you a linear function, we want all those wiggles (non-linearity) so we use ReLUs.\nReLU: IF(lin1 &lt; 0, 0, lin1)\nPreds = sum of the two ReLUs.\nLoss same as regression.\nSolver process the same as well.\n\nNeural Net (Matrix Multiplication)\n\nTranspose params into two columns.\n=MMULT(...) for Lin1 and Lin2 columns.\nKeep ReLU, Preds and Loss column the same.\nOptimize params using Solver.\nHelpful reminder to build intuition around matrix multiplication: it’s doing the same thing as the SUMPRODUCTs.\n\nDummy variables: Pclass_1, Pclass_2, etc.\n\nNext lesson: NLP\n\nIt’s about making predictions with text data which most of the time is in the form of prose.\nFirst Farsi NLP resource was created by a student of the first fastai course.\nNLP most commonly and practically used for classification.\nDocument = one or two words, a book, a wikipedia page, any length.\nClassification = figure out a category for a document.\nSentiment analysis\nAuthor identification\nLegal discovery (is this document in-scope or out-of-scope)\nOrganizing documents by topic\nTriaging inbound emails\nClassification of text looks similar to images.\nWe’re going to use a different library: HuggingFace Transformers\n\nHelpful to see how things are done in more than one library.\nHuggingFace Transformers doesn’t have the same high-level API. Have to do more stuff manually. Which is good for students at this point of the course.\nIt’s a good library.\n\nBefore the next lesson take a look at the NLP notebook and U.S. Patent to Phrase Matching data.\n\nTrying to figure out in patents whether two concepts are referring to the same thing. The document is text1, text2, and the category is similar (1) or not-similar (0).\n\nWill also talk about the two very important topics of validation sets and metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll train a Pets dataset classifier as done by Jeremy in this notebook.\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\nimport timm\n\n\npath = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'\n\n# Create DataLoaders object\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func('.',\n                                      get_image_files(path),\n                                      valid_pct=0.2,\n                                      seed=42,\n                                      label_func=RegexLabeller(pat = r'^([^/]+)_\\d+'),\n                                      item_tfms=Resize(224))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [811712512/811706944 01:00&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\ndls.show_batch(max_n=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# train using resnet34 as architecture\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(3)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future.

We need to automate this process.\nIf we know the gradient of our mae() function with respect to our parameters, a, b and c, then that means we know how adjusting a parameter will change the function. If, say, a has a negative gradient, then we know increasing a will decrease mae(). So we find the gradient of the parameters with respect to the loss function and adjust our parameters a bit in the opposite direction of the gradient sign.\nTo do this we need a function that will take the parameters as a single vector:\n\ndef quad_mae(params):\n    f = mk_quad(*params)\n    return mae(f(x), y)\n\n\n# testing it out\n# should equal 2.4219\nquad_mae([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n\n\n# pick an arbitrary starting point for our parameters\nabc = torch.tensor([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\n# tell pytorch to calculate its gradients\nabc.requires_grad_()\n\n# calculate loss\nloss = quad_mae(abc)\nloss\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\n# calculate gradients\nloss.backward()\n\n# view gradients\nabc.grad\n\ntensor([-1.3529, -0.0316, -0.5000])\n\n\n\n# increase parameters to decrease loss based on gradient sign\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n\nprint(f'loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nloss=2.40\n\n\nThe loss has gone down from 2.4219 to 2.40. We’re moving in the right direction.\nThe small number we multiply gradients by is called the learning rate and is the most important hyper-parameter to set when training a neural network.\n\n# use a loop to do a few more iterations\nfor i in range(10):\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    loss.backward()\n    with torch.no_grad(): abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    print(f'step={i}; loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nstep=0; loss=2.40\nstep=1; loss=2.36\nstep=2; loss=2.30\nstep=3; loss=2.21\nstep=4; loss=2.11\nstep=5; loss=1.98\nstep=6; loss=1.85\nstep=7; loss=1.72\nstep=8; loss=1.58\nstep=9; loss=1.46\n\n\nThe loss continues to decrease.

Drawing squiggly lines through some points is literally all that deep learning does. The above steps will, given enough time and enough data, create (for example) an owl recognizer if you feed it enough owls and non-owls.\nWe can could do thousands of computations on a GPU instead of the above CPU computation. We can greatly reduce the amount of computation and data needed by using a convolution instead of a matrix multiplication. We could make things much faster if, instead of starting with random parameters, we start with parameters of someone else’s model that does something similar to what we want (transfer learning).\n\n\n\nFollowing the instructions in the fastai course lesson video, I’ve created a Microsoft Excel deep learning model here for the Titanic Kaggle data.\nAs shown in the course video, I trained three different models—linear regression, neural net (using SUMPRODUCT) and neural net (using MMULT). After running Microsoft Excel’s Solver, I got the final (different than video) mean loss for each model:\n\nlinear: 0.14422715\nnnet: 0.14385956\nmmult: 0.14385956\n\nThe linear model loss in the video was about 0.10 and the neural net loss was about 0.08. So, my models didn’t do as well.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes while reading Chapter 4 in the fastai textbook.\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the MNIST dataset for our experiments, which contains handwritten digits.\nMNIST is collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and collated into a machine learning dataset by Yann Lecun who used MNIST in 1998 in LeNet-5, the first computer system to demonstrate practically useful recognition of handwritten digits.\nWe’ve seen that the only consisten trait among every fast.ai student who’s gone on to be a world-class practitioner is that they are all very tenacious.\nIn this chapter we’ll create a model that can classify any image as a 3 or a 7.\n\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n\npath = untar_data(URLs.MNIST_SAMPLE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.14% [3219456/3214948 00:00&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n# ls method added by fastai\n# lists the count of items\npath.ls()\n\n(#3) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/labels.csv'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid')]\n\n\n\n(path/'train').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/7')]\n\n\n\n# 3 and 7 are the labels\nthrees = (path/'train'/'3').ls().sorted()\nsevens = (path/'train'/'7').ls().sorted()\nthrees\n\n(#6131) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10000.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10011.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10031.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10034.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10042.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10052.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/1007.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10074.png'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3/10091.png')...]\n\n\n\n# view one of the images\nim3_path = threes[1]\nim3 = Image.open(im3_path)\nim3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the image is stored as numbers\narray(im3)[4:10, 4:10]\n\narray([[  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],\n       [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  29],\n       [  0,   0,   0,  48, 166, 224],\n       [  0,  93, 244, 249, 253, 187],\n       [  0, 107, 253, 253, 230,  48],\n       [  0,   3,  20,  20,  15,   0]], dtype=uint8)\n\n\n\n# same thing, but a PyTorch tensor\ntensor(im3)[4:10, 4:10]\n\ntensor([[  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],\n        [  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  29],\n        [  0,   0,   0,  48, 166, 224],\n        [  0,  93, 244, 249, 253, 187],\n        [  0, 107, 253, 253, 230,  48],\n        [  0,   3,  20,  20,  15,   0]], dtype=torch.uint8)\n\n\n\n# use pandas.DataFrame to color code the array\nim3_t = tensor(im3)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(im3_t[4:15, 4:22])\ndf.style.set_properties(**{'font-size': '6pt'}).background_gradient('Greys')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n29\n150\n195\n254\n255\n254\n176\n193\n150\n96\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n48\n166\n224\n253\n253\n234\n196\n253\n253\n253\n253\n233\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n0\n93\n244\n249\n253\n187\n46\n10\n8\n4\n10\n194\n253\n253\n233\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n107\n253\n253\n230\n48\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n192\n253\n253\n156\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n5\n0\n3\n20\n20\n15\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n43\n224\n253\n245\n74\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n249\n253\n245\n126\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n14\n101\n223\n253\n248\n124\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n11\n166\n239\n253\n253\n253\n187\n30\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n16\n248\n250\n253\n253\n253\n253\n232\n213\n111\n2\n0\n0\n\n\n10\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n43\n98\n98\n208\n253\n253\n253\n253\n187\n22\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe background white pixels are stored a the number 0, black is the number 255, and shades of grey between the two. The entire image contains 28 pixels across and 28 pixels down for a total of 768 pixels.\nHow might a computer recognize these two digits?\nIdeas:\n3s and 7s have distinct features. A seven has generally two straight lines at different angles, a three as two sets of curves stacked on each other. The point where the two curves intersect could be a recognizable feature of the the digit three. The point where the two straight-ish lines intersect could be a recognizable feature of the digit seven. One feature of confusion could be handwritten threes with a straight line at the top, similar to a seven. Another feature of confusion could be a handwritten 3 with a straight-ish ending stroke at the bottom, matching a similar stroke of a 7.\n\n\n\nIdea: find the average pixel value for every pixel of the 3s, then do the same for the 7s. To classify an image, see which of the two ideal digits the image is most similar to.\n\nBaseline: A simple model that you are confident should perform reasonably well. It should be simple to implement and easy to test, so that you can then test each of your improved ideas and make sure they are always better than your baseline. Without starting with a sensible baseline, it is difficult to know whether your super-fancy models are any good.\n\n\n# list comprehension of all digit images\nseven_tensors = [tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in sevens]\nthree_tensors = [tensor(Image.open(o)) for o in threes]\nlen(three_tensors), len(seven_tensors)\n\n(6131, 6265)\n\n\n\n# use fastai's show_image to display tensor images\nshow_image(three_tensors[1]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor every pixel position, we want to compute the average over all the images of the intensity of that pixel.

We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would “learn” from its experience.\n\nOur pixel similarity approach doesn’t have any weight assignment, or any way of improving based on testing the effectiveness of a weight assignment. We can’t improve our pixel similarity approach.\nWe could look at each individual pixel and come up with a set of weights for each, such that the highest weights are associated with those pixels most likely to be black for a particular category. For example, pixels toward the bottom right are not very likely to be activate for a 7, so they should have a low weight for a 7, but ther are likely to be activated for an 8, so they should have a high weight for an 8. This can be represented as a function and set of weight values for each possible category, for instance, the probability of being the number 8:\ndef pr_eight(x,w) = (x*w).sum()\nX is the image, represented as a vector (with all the rows stacked up end to end into a single long line) and the weights are a vector W. We need some way to update the weights to make them a little bit better. We want to find the specific values for the vector W that cause the result of our function to be high for those images that are 8s and low for those images that are not. Searching for the best vector W is a way to search for the best function for recognizing 8s.\nSteps required to turn this function into a machine learning classifier:\n\nInitialize the weights.\nFor each image, use these weights to predict whether it appears to be a 3 or a 7.\nBased on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its loss).\nCalculate the gradient, which measures for each weight how changing that weight would change the loss.\nStep (that is, change) all the weights based on that calculation.\nGo back to step 2 and repeat the process.\nIterate until you decide to stop the training process (for instance, because the model is good enough or you don’t want to wait any longer).\n\nInitialize: Initialize parameters to random values.\nLoss: We need a function that will return a number that is small if the performance of the model is good (by convention).\nStep: Gradients allow us to directly figure out in which direction and by roughly how much to change each weight.\nStop: Keep training until the accuracy of the model started getting worse or we ran out of time, or once the number of epochs we decided are complete.\n\n\n\nCreate an example loss function:\n\ndef f(x): return x**2\n\nPick a tensor value at which we want gradients:\n\nxt = tensor(3.).requires_grad_()\n\n\nyt = f(xt)\nyt\n\ntensor(9., grad_fn=&lt;PowBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nCalculate gradients (backpropagation–during the backward pass of the network, as opposed to forward pass which is where the activations are calculated):\n\nyt.backward()\n\nView the gradients:\n\nxt.grad\n\ntensor(6.)\n\n\nThe derivative of x**2 is 2*x. When x = 3 the derivative is 6, as calculated above.\nCalculating vector gradients:\n\nxt = tensor([3., 4., 10.]).requires_grad_()\nxt\n\ntensor([ 3.,  4., 10.], requires_grad=True)\n\n\nAdd sum to our function so it takes a vector and returns a scalar:\n\ndef f(x): return (x**2).sum()\n\n\nyt = f(xt)\nyt\n\ntensor(125., grad_fn=&lt;SumBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nyt.backward()\nxt.grad\n\ntensor([ 6.,  8., 20.])\n\n\nIf the gradients are very large, that may suggest that we have more adjustments to do, whereas if they are very small, that may suggest that we are close to the optimal value.\n\n\n\nDeciding how to change our parameters based on the values of the gradients—multiplying the gradient by some small number called the learning rate (LR):\nw -= w.grad * lr\nThis is knowns as stepping your parameters using an optimization step.\nIf you pick a learning rate too low, that can mean having to do a lot of steps. If you pick a learning rate too high, that’s even worse, because it can result in the loss getting worse. If the learning rate is too high it may also “bounce” around.\n\n\n\nExample: measuring the speed of a roller coaster as it went over the top of a hump.

It’s not useful to use accuracy as a loss function.\nWe need a loss function that when our weights result in slightly better predictions, gives us a slightly better loss.\nIn this case, what does “slightly better prediction mean”: if the correct answer is 3 (1), the score is a little higher, or if the correct answer is a 7 (0), the score is a little lower.\nThe loss function receives not the images themselves, but the predictions from the model.\nThe loss function will measure how distant each prediction is from 1 (if it should be 1) and how distant it is from 0 (if it should be 0) and then it will take the mean of all those distances.\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\nTry it out with sample predictions and targets:\n\ntrgts = tensor([1,0,1])\nprds = tensor([0.9, 0.4, 0.2])\ntorch.where(trgts==1, 1-prds, prds)\n\ntensor([0.1000, 0.4000, 0.8000])\n\n\nThis function returns a lower number when predictions are more accurate, when accurate predictions are more confident and when inaccurate predictions are less confident.\nSince we need a scalar for the final loss, mnist_loss takes the mean of the previous tensor:\n\nmnist_loss(prds, trgts)\n\ntensor(0.4333)\n\n\nmnist_loss assumes that predictions are between 0 and 1. We need to ensure that, using sigmoid, which always outputs a number between 0 and 1:\n\ndef sigmoid(x): return 1/(1+torch.exp(-x))\n\n\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, title='Sigmoid', min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s also a smooth curve that only goes up, which makes it easier for SGD to find meaningful gradients. Update mnist+loss to first apply sigmoid to the inputs:\n\ndef mnist_loss(predictions, targets):\n  predictions = predictions.sigmoid()\n  return torch.where(targets==1, 1-predictions, predictions).mean()\n\nWe already had a metric, which was overall accuracy. So why did we define a loss?\nTo drive automated learning, the loss must be a function that has a meaningful derivative. It can’t have big flat sections and large jumps, but instead must be reasonably smooth. This is why we designed a loss function that would respond to small changes in confidence level.\nThe loss function is calculated for each item in our dataset, and then at the end of an epoch, the loss values are all averaged and the overall mean is reported for the epoch.\nIt is important that we focus on metrics, rather than the loss, when judging the performance of a model.\n\n\nThe optimization step: change or update the weights based on the gradients.\nTo take an optimization step, we need to calculate the loss over one or more data items. Calculating the loss for the whole dataset would take a long time, calculating it for a single item would not use much information so it would result in an imprecise and unstable gradient.\nCalculate the average loss for a few data items at a time (mini-batch). The number of data items in the mini-batch is called the batch-size.\nA larger batch size means you will get a more accurate and stable estimate of your dataset’s gradients from the loss function, but it will take longer and you will process fewer mini-batches per epoch. Using batches of data works well for GPUs, but give the GPU too many items at once and it will run out of memory.\nWe get better generalization if we can vary things during training (like performing data augmentation). One simple and effective thing we can vary is what data items we put in each mini-batch. Randomly shuffly the dataset before we create mini-batches. The DataLoader will do the shuffling and mini-batch collation for you:\n\ncoll = range(15)\ndl = DataLoader(coll, batch_size=5, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[tensor([10,  3,  8, 11,  0]),\n tensor([6, 1, 7, 9, 4]),\n tensor([12, 13,  5,  2, 14])]\n\n\nFor training, we want a collection containing independent and dependent variables. A Dataset in PyTorch is a collection containing tuples of independent and dependent variables.\n\nds = L(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase))\nds\n\n(#26) [(0, 'a'),(1, 'b'),(2, 'c'),(3, 'd'),(4, 'e'),(5, 'f'),(6, 'g'),(7, 'h'),(8, 'i'),(9, 'j')...]\n\n\n\nlist(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase))[:5]\n\n[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd'), (4, 'e')]\n\n\nWhen we pass a Dataset to a Dataloader we will get back many batches that are themselves tuples of tensors representing batches of independent and dependent variables:\n\ndl = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=6, shuffle=True)\nlist(dl)\n\n[(tensor([24,  2,  4,  8,  9, 13]), ('y', 'c', 'e', 'i', 'j', 'n')),\n (tensor([23, 17,  6, 14, 25, 18]), ('x', 'r', 'g', 'o', 'z', 's')),\n (tensor([22,  5,  7, 20,  3, 19]), ('w', 'f', 'h', 'u', 'd', 't')),\n (tensor([ 0, 21, 12,  1, 16, 10]), ('a', 'v', 'm', 'b', 'q', 'k')),\n (tensor([11, 15]), ('l', 'p'))]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn code, the process will be implemented something like this for each epoch:\nfor x,y in dl:\n  # calculate predictions\n  pred = model(x)\n  # calculate the loss\n  loss = loss_func(pred, y)\n  # calculate the gradients\n  loss.backward()\n  # step the weights\n  parameters -= parameters.grad * lr\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n\nweights = init_params((28*28, 1))\nbias = init_params(1)\n\nA DataLoader can be created from a Dataset:\n\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nxb,yb = first(dl)\nxb.shape, yb.shape\n\n(torch.Size([256, 784]), torch.Size([256, 1]))\n\n\nDo the same for the validation set:\n\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256)\n\nCreate a mini-batch of size 4 for testing:\n\nbatch = train_x[:4]\nbatch.shape\n\ntorch.Size([4, 784])\n\n\n\npreds = linear1(batch)\npreds\n\ntensor([[10.4546],\n        [ 9.4603],\n        [-0.2426],\n        [ 6.7868]], grad_fn=&lt;AddBackward0&gt;)\n\n\n\nloss = mnist_loss(preds, train_y[:4])\nloss\n\ntensor(0.1404, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate the gradients\n\nloss.backward()\nweights.grad.shape, weights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(torch.Size([784, 1]), tensor(-0.0089), tensor([-0.0619]))\n\n\nCreate a function to calculate gradients:\n\ndef calc_grad(xb, yb, model):\n  preds = model(xb)\n  loss = mnist_loss(preds, yb)\n  loss.backward()\n\nTest it:\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0178), tensor([-0.1238]))\n\n\nLook what happens when we call it again:\n\ncalc_grad(batch, train_y[:4], linear1)\nweights.grad.mean(), bias.grad\n\n(tensor(-0.0267), tensor([-0.1857]))\n\n\nThe gradients have changed. loss.backward adds the gradients of loss to any gradients that are currently stored. So we have to set the current gradients to 0 first:\n\nweights.grad.zero_()\nbias.grad.zero_();\n\nMethods in PyTorch whose names end in an underscore modify their objects in place.\nStep 5: Step the weights\nWhen we update the weights and biases based on the gradient and learning rate, we have to tell PyTorch not to take the gradient of this step. If we assign to the data attribute of a tensor, PyTorch will not take the gradient of that step. Here’s our basic training loop for an epoch:\n\ndef train_epoch(model, lr, params):\n  for xb,yb in dl:\n    calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n    for p in params:\n      p.data -= p.grad*lr\n      p.grad.zero_()\n\nWe want to check how we’re doing by looking at the accuracy of the validation set.

Modules are classes so you have to instantiate them.\n\nlearn = Learner(dls, simple_net, opt_func=SGD,\n                loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\n\n\nlearn.fit(40, 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nbatch_accuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.363529\n0.409795\n0.505888\n00:00\n\n\n1\n0.165949\n0.239534\n0.792934\n00:00\n\n\n2\n0.089140\n0.117148\n0.913150\n00:00\n\n\n3\n0.056798\n0.078107\n0.941119\n00:00\n\n\n4\n0.042071\n0.060734\n0.957311\n00:00\n\n\n5\n0.034718\n0.051121\n0.962218\n00:00\n\n\n6\n0.030605\n0.045103\n0.964181\n00:00\n\n\n7\n0.027994\n0.040995\n0.966143\n00:00\n\n\n8\n0.026145\n0.037990\n0.969087\n00:00\n\n\n9\n0.024728\n0.035686\n0.970559\n00:00\n\n\n10\n0.023585\n0.033853\n0.972522\n00:00\n\n\n11\n0.022634\n0.032346\n0.973994\n00:00\n\n\n12\n0.021826\n0.031080\n0.975466\n00:00\n\n\n13\n0.021127\n0.029996\n0.976448\n00:00\n\n\n14\n0.020514\n0.029053\n0.975957\n00:00\n\n\n15\n0.019972\n0.028221\n0.976448\n00:00\n\n\n16\n0.019488\n0.027481\n0.977920\n00:00\n\n\n17\n0.019051\n0.026818\n0.978410\n00:00\n\n\n18\n0.018654\n0.026219\n0.978410\n00:00\n\n\n19\n0.018291\n0.025677\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n20\n0.017958\n0.025181\n0.978901\n00:00\n\n\n21\n0.017650\n0.024727\n0.980373\n00:00\n\n\n22\n0.017363\n0.024310\n0.980864\n00:00\n\n\n23\n0.017096\n0.023925\n0.980864\n00:00\n\n\n24\n0.016846\n0.023570\n0.981845\n00:00\n\n\n25\n0.016610\n0.023241\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n26\n0.016389\n0.022935\n0.982336\n00:00\n\n\n27\n0.016179\n0.022652\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n28\n0.015980\n0.022388\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n29\n0.015791\n0.022142\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n30\n0.015611\n0.021913\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n31\n0.015440\n0.021700\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n32\n0.015276\n0.021500\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n33\n0.015120\n0.021313\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n34\n0.014969\n0.021137\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n35\n0.014825\n0.020972\n0.983317\n00:00\n\n\n36\n0.014686\n0.020817\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n37\n0.014553\n0.020671\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n38\n0.014424\n0.020532\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n39\n0.014300\n0.020401\n0.982826\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can view the training process in learn.recorder:\n\nplt.plot(L(learn.recorder.values).itemgot(2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the final accuracy:\n\nlearn.recorder.values[-1][2]\n\n0.982826292514801\n\n\nAt this point we have:\n\nA function that can solve any problem to any level of accuracy (the neural network) given the correct set of parameters.\nA way to find the best set of parameters for any function (stochastic gradient descent).\n\n\n\nWe can add as many layers in our neural network as we want, as long as we add a nonlinearity between each pair of linear layers.\nThe deeper the model gets, the harder it is to optimize the parameters.\nWith a deeper model (one with more layers) we do not need to use as many parameters. We can use smaller matrices with more layers and get better results than we would get with larger matrices and few layers.\nIn the 1990s what held back the field for years was that so few researchers were experimenting with more than one nonlinearity.\nTraining an 18-layer model:\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path)\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=False,\n                    loss_func=F.cross_entropy, metrics=accuracy)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.1)\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/fastai/vision/learner.py:288: UserWarning: `cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\n  warn(\"`cnn_learner` has been renamed to `vision_learner` -- please update your code\")\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:208: UserWarning: The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future, please use 'weights' instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future.

The number of dimensions of a tensor is its rank.\nA neural network contains a number of layers. Each layer is either linear or nonlinear. We generally alternate between these two kinds of layers in a neural network. Sometimes a nonlinearity is referred to as an activation function.\nKey concepts related to SGD:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nReLU\nFunction that returns 0 for negative numbers and doesn’t change positive numbers.\n\n\nMini-batch\nA small group of inputs and labels gathered together in two arrays.

How is a grayscale image represented on a computer? How about a color image?\nGrayscale image pixels can be 0 (black) to 255 (white). Color image pixels have three values (Red, Green, Blue) where each value can be from 0 to 255.\n2. How are the files and folders in the MNIST_SAMPLE dataset structured? Why?\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#3) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/labels.csv'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid')]\n\n\nMNIST_SAMPLE path has a labels.csv file, a train folder, and a valid folder.\n\n(path/'train').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/train/7')]\n\n\nThe train folder has a 3 and a 7 folder, each which contains training images.\n\n(path/'valid').ls()\n\n(#2) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid/3'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/mnist_sample/valid/7')]\n\n\nThe valid folder contains a 3 and a 7 folder, each containing validation set images.\n3. Explain how the “pixel similarity” approach to classifying digits works.\nPixel similarity works by calculating the absolute mean difference (L1 norm) between each image and the mean digit 3, and averaging the classification (if the absolute mean difference between the image and the ideal 3 is less than the absolute mean difference between the image and the ideal 7, it’s classified as a 3) across all images of each digit’s validation set as the accuracy of the model.\n4. What is list comprehension? Create one now that selects odd numbers from a list and doubles them.\nList comprehension is syntax for creating a new list based on another sequence or iterable (docs)\n\n# for each element in range(10)\n# if the modulo of the element and 2 is not 0\n# double the element's value and store in this new list\ndoubled_odds = [2*elem for elem in range(10) if elem % 2 != 0]\ndoubled_odds\n\n[2, 6, 10, 14, 18]\n\n\n5. What is a rank-3 tensor?\nA rank-3 tensor is a “cube” (3-dimensional tensor).\n6. What is the difference between tensor rank and shape? How do you get the rank from the shape?\nTensor rank is the number of dimensions of the tensor. Tensor shape is the number of elements in each dimension. The following tensor is a 2-dimensional tensor with rank 2, the shape of which is 3 elements by 2 elements.\n\na_tensor = tensor([[1,3], [4,5], [5,6]])\n# dim == rank\na_tensor.dim(), a_tensor.shape\n\n(2, torch.Size([3, 2]))\n\n\n7. What are RMSE and L1 norm?\nRMSE = Root Mean Squared Error: The square root of the mean of squared differences between two sets of values.\nL1 norm = mean absolute difference: the mean of the absolute value of differences between two sets of values.\n8. How can you apply a calculation on thousands of numbers at once, many thousands of times faster than a Python loop?\nYou can do so by using tensors on a GPU.\n9. Create a 3x3 tensor or array containing the numbers from 1 to 9. Double it. Select the bottom four numbers.\n\na_tensor = tensor([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])\na_tensor\n\ntensor([[1, 2, 3],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\n\na_tensor = 2 * a_tensor\na_tensor\n\ntensor([[ 2,  4,  6],\n        [ 8, 10, 12],\n        [14, 16, 18]])\n\n\n\na_tensor.view(-1, 9)[0,-4:]\n\ntensor([12, 14, 16, 18])\n\n\n10. What is broadcasting? Broadcasting is when a tensor of smaller rank (or a scalar) is expanded so that you can perform an operation between it and a tensor of larger rank. Broadcasting makes it so that the two operands have the same rank.\n\na_tensor + tensor([1,2,3])\n\ntensor([[ 3,  6,  9],\n        [ 9, 12, 15],\n        [15, 18, 21]])\n\n\n\nAre metrics generally calculated using the training set or the validation set? Why?\n\nMetrics are calculated on the validation set because since that is the data the model does not see during training, the metric tells you how your model performs on data it hasn’t seen before.\n12. What is SGD?\nSGD is Stochastic Gradient Descent, an automated process where a model learns the right parameters needed to solve problems like image classification. The randomly (from scratch) or pretrained (transfer learning) parameters are updated using their gradients with respect to the loss and the learning rate. Metrics like the accuracy measure how well the model is performing.\n13. Why does SGD use mini-batches?\nOne reason is to utilize the ability of a GPU to process a lot of data at once.\nAnother reason is that calculating the loss one image at a time leads to an unstable loss function whereas calculating the loss on the entire dataset takes too long. Mini-batches fall in between these two extremes.\n14. What are the seven steps in SGD for machine learning?\n\nInitialize the weights.\nCalculate the predictions.\nCalculate the loss.\nCalculate gradients.\nStep the weights.\nRepeat the process.\nStop.\n\n15. How do we initialize the weights in a model?\nEither randomly (if training from scratch) or using pretrained weights (if transfer learning from an existing model like resnet18).\n16. What is loss?\nA machine-friendly way to measure how well (or badly) the model is performing. The model is learning to step the weights in order to decrease the loss.\n17. Why can’t we always use a high learning rate?\nBecause we risk overshooting the minimum loss (getting stuck back and forth between the two sides of the parabola) or diverging (resulting in larger losses each step).\n18. What is a gradient?\nThe rate of change or derivative of one variable with respect to another variable. In our case, gradients are the ratio of change in loss to change in parameter at one point.\n19. Do you need to know how to calculate gradients yourself?\nNope! Although you should understand the basic concept of derivatives. PyTorch calculates gradients with the .backward method.\n20. Why can’t we use accuracy as a loss function?\nBecause small changes in predictions do not result in small changes in accuracy. Accuracy drastically jumps (from 0 to 1 in our MNIST_SAMPLE example) at one point, with 0 slope elsewhere. We want a smooth function where you can calculate non-zero and non-infinite derivatives everywhere.\n21. Draw the sigmoid function. What is special about its shape?\nThe sigmoid function outputs between 0 and 1 for input values going from -inf to +inf. It also has a smooth positive slope everywhere so it’s easy to take the derivate.\n\nplot_function(torch.sigmoid, title='Sigmoid', min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22. What is the difference between a loss function and a metric?\nThe loss function is a machine-friendly way to measure the performance of the model while a metric is a human-friendly way to do the same.\nThe purpose of the loss function is to provide a smooth function to take derivates over so the training system can change the weights little by little towards the optimum.\nThe purpose of the metric is to inform the human how well or badly the model is learning during training.\n23. What is the function to calculate new weights using a learning rate?\nIn code, the function is:\nparameters.data -= parameters.grad * lr\nThe new weights are stepped incrementally in the opposite direction of the gradients. If the gradient is negative, the weights will be increased. If the gradient is positive, the weights will be decreased.\n24. What does the DataLoader class do?\nThe DataLoader class prepares training and validation batches and feeds them to the GPU during training. It also performs any necessary item_tfms or batch_tfms to the data.\n25. Write pseudocode showing the basic steps taken in each epoch for SGD.\ndef train_epoch(model):\n  # calculate predictions\n  preds = model(xb)\n  # calculate the loss\n  loss = loss_func(preds, targets)\n  # calculate gradients\n  loss.backward()\n  # step the weights\n  params.data -= params.grad * lr\n  # reset the gradients\n  params.zero_grad_()\n  # calculate accuracy\n  acc = tensor([accuracy for each batch]).mean()\n\nCreate a function that, if passed two arguments [1, 2, 3, 4] and 'abcd', returns [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]. What is special about that output data structure?\n\n\ndef zipped_tuples(x, y): return list(zip(x,y))\n\n\nzipped_tuples([1,2,3,4], 'abcd')\n\n[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]\n\n\nThe output data structure is the same structure as the PyTorch Dataset.\n27. What does view do in PyTorch?\nview changes the rank and shape of the tensor.\n\ntensor([1,2,3],[4,5,6]).view(3,2)\n\ntensor([[1, 2],\n        [3, 4],\n        [5, 6]])\n\n\n\ntensor([1,2,3],[4,5,6]).view(6)\n\ntensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n\n\n28. What are the bias parameters in a neural network? Why do we need them?\nThe bias parameters are the intercept \\(b\\) in the function \\(y = wx + b\\). We need them for situations where the inputs are 0 (since \\(w*0 = 0\\)). Bias also helps to create a more flexible function (source).\n29. What does the @ operator do in Python?\nMatrix multiplication.\n\nv1 = tensor([1,2,3])\nv2 = tensor([4,5,6])\nv1 @ v2\n\ntensor(32)\n\n\n30. What does the backward method do?\nCalculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters.\n31. Why do we have to zero the gradients?\nEach time you call .backward PyTorch will add the new gradients to the current gradients, so we need to zero the gradients to prevent them from accumulating.\n32. What information do we have to pass to Learner?\nReference:\nLearner(dls, simple_net, opt_func=SGD,\n            loss_func=mnist_loss, metrics=batch_accuracy)\nWe pass to the Learner:\n\nDataLoaders containing training and validation sets.\nThe model we want to train.\nAn optimizer function.\nA loss function.\nAny metrics we want calculated.\n\n33. Show Python or pseudocode for the basic steps of a training loop.\nSee #25.\n34. What is ReLU? Draw a plot for it for values from -2 to +2.\nReLU is Rectified Linear Unit. It’s a function where if the inputs are negative, they are set to zero, and if the inputs are positive, they are kept as is.\n\nplot_function(F.relu, min=-2, max=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35. What is an activation function?\nAn activation function is the function that produces our predictions (in our case, a neural net with linear and nonlinear layers). Sometimes the ReLU is referred to as the activation function.\n36. What’s the difference between F.relu and nn.ReLU?\nF.relu is a function whereas nn.ReLU is a class that needs to be instantiated.\n37. The universal approximation theorem shows that any function can be approximated as closely as needed using just one nonlinearity. So why wo we normally use more?\nUsing more layers results in more accurate models.\n\n\n\nSince this lesson’s Further Research was so intensive, I decided to create separate blog posts for each one:\n\nImplementing a fastai Learner from Scratch\nImplementing an MNIST Classifier from Scratch"

We can create one like so:\n\nfrom datasets import Dataset, DatasetDict\n\nds = Dataset.from_pandas(df)\n\n\nds\n\nDataset({\n    features: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'score', 'input'],\n    num_rows: 36473\n})\n\n\nA deep learning model expects numbers as inputs, not English sentences! So we need to do two things:\n\nTokenization: Split each text up into words (tokens).\nNumericalization: Convert each word (or token) into a number.\n\nThe details on how this is done depends on the model. So pick a model first:\n\nmodel_nm = 'microsoft/deberta-v3-small'\n\nAutoTokenizer will create a tokenizer appropriate for a given model:\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification,AutoTokenizer\ntokz = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/convert_slow_tokenizer.py:470: UserWarning: The sentencepiece tokenizer that you are converting to a fast tokenizer uses the byte fallback option which is not implemented in the fast tokenizers. In practice this means that the fast version of the tokenizer can produce unknown tokens whereas the sentencepiece version would have converted these unknown tokens into a sequence of byte tokens matching the original piece of text.\n  warnings.warn(\nSpecial tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n\n\nHere’s an example of how the tokenizer splits a text into “tokens” (which are like words, but can be sub-word pieces):\n\ntokz.tokenize(\"G'day folks, I'm Jeremy from fast.ai!\")\n\n['▁G',\n \"'\",\n 'day',\n '▁folks',\n ',',\n '▁I',\n \"'\",\n 'm',\n '▁Jeremy',\n '▁from',\n '▁fast',\n '.',\n 'ai',\n '!']\n\n\nUncommon words will be split into pieces. The start of a new word is represented by _.\n\ntokz.tokenize(\"A platypus is an ornithorhynchus anatinus.\")\n\n['▁A',\n '▁platypus',\n '▁is',\n '▁an',\n '▁or',\n 'ni',\n 'tho',\n 'rhynch',\n 'us',\n '▁an',\n 'at',\n 'inus',\n '.']\n\n\nHere’s a simple function which tokenizes our inputs:\n\ndef tok_func(x): return tokz(x[\"input\"])\n\nTo run this quickly in parallel on every row in our dataset, use map:\n\ntok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True)\n\n\n\n\nThis adds a new item to our dataset called input_ids. For instance, here is the input and IDs for the first row of our data:\n\nrow = tok_ds[0]\nrow['input'], row['input_ids']\n\n('TEXT1: A47; TEXT2: abatement of pollution; ANC1: abatement',\n [1,\n  54453,\n  435,\n  294,\n  336,\n  5753,\n  346,\n  54453,\n  445,\n  294,\n  47284,\n  265,\n  6435,\n  346,\n  23702,\n  435,\n  294,\n  47284,\n  2])\n\n\nThere’s a list called vocab in the tokenizer which contains a unique integer for every possible token string. We can look them up like this, for instance to find the token for the word “of”:\n\ntokz.vocab['▁of']\n\n265\n\n\n265 is present in our input_ids for the first row of data.\n\ntokz.vocab['of']\n\n1580\n\n\nFinally, we need to prepare our labels. Transformers always assumes that your labels has the column name labels, but in our dataset it’s currently score. Therefore, we need to rename it:\n\ntok_ds = tok_ds.rename_columns({'score':'labels'})\n\n\n\n\n\neval_df = pd.read_csv(path/'test.csv')\neval_df.describe()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nanchor\ntarget\ncontext\n\n\n\n\ncount\n36\n36\n36\n36\n\n\nunique\n36\n34\n36\n29\n\n\ntop\n4112d61851461f60\nel display\ninorganic photoconductor drum\nG02\n\n\nfreq\n1\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nThis is the test set. Possibly the most important idea in machine learning is that of having separate training, validation, and test data sets.\n\n\nTo explain the motivation, let’s start simple, and imagine we’re trying to fit a model where the true relationship is this quadratic:\n\ndef f(x): return -3*x**2 + 2*x + 20\n\nUnfortunately matplotlib (the most common library for plotting in Python) doesn’t come with a way to visualize a function, so we’ll write something to do this ourselves:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_function(f, min=-2.1, max=2.1, color='r'):\n    x = np.linspace(min,max, 100)[:,None]\n    plt.plot(x, f(x), color)\n\n\nplot_function(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, perhaps we’ve measured the height above ground of an object before and after some event. The measurements will have some random error. We can use numpy’s random number generator to simulate that. I like to use seed when writing about simulations like this so that I know you’ll see the same thing I do:\n\nfrom numpy.random import normal,seed,uniform\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n\ndef noise(x, scale): return normal(scale=scale, size=x.shape)\ndef add_noise(x, mult, add): return x * (1+noise(x,mult)) + noise(x,add)\n\n\nx = np.linspace(-2, 2, num=20)[:,None]\ny = add_noise(f(x), 0.2, 1.3)\nplt.scatter(x,y);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see what happens if we underfit or overfit these predictions. To do that, we’ll create a function that fits a polynomial of some degree (e.g. a line is degree 1, quadratic is degree 2, cubic is degree 3, etc). The details of how this function works don’t matter too much so feel free to skip over it if you like!\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n\ndef plot_poly(degree):\n    model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree), LinearRegression())\n    model.fit(x, y)\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    plot_function(model.predict)\n\n\nplot_poly(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you see, the points on the red line (the line we fitted) aren’t very close at all. This is under-fit – there’s not enough detail in our function to match our data.\nAnd what happens if we fit a degree 10 polynomial to our measurements?\n\nplot_poly(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell now it fits our data better, but it doesn’t look like it’ll do a great job predicting points other than those we measured – especially those in earlier or later time periods. This is over-fit – there’s too much detail such that the model fits our points, but not the underlying process we really care about.\nLet’s try a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic), and compare it to our “true” function (in blue):\n\nplot_poly(2)\nplot_function(f, color='b')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not bad at all!\nSo, how do we recognise whether our models are under-fit, over-fit, or “just right”? We use a validation set. This is a set of data that we “hold out” from training – we don’t let our model see it at all. If you use the fastai library, it automatically creates a validation set for you if you don’t have one, and will always report metrics (measurements of the accuracy of a model) using the validation set.\nThe validation set is only ever used to see how we’re doing. It’s never used as inputs to training the model.\nTransformers uses a DatasetDict for holding your training and validation sets. To create one that contains 25% of our data for the validation set, and 75% for the training set, use train_test_split:\n\ndds = tok_ds.train_test_split(0.25, seed=42)\ndds\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'labels', 'input', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 27354\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'anchor', 'target', 'context', 'labels', 'input', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 9119\n    })\n})\n\n\nAs you see above, the validation set here is called test and not validate, so be careful!\nIn practice, a random split like we’ve used here might not be a good idea – here’s what Dr Rachel Thomas has to say about it:\n\n“One of the most likely culprits for this disconnect between results in development vs results in production is a poorly chosen validation set (or even worse, no validation set at all). Depending on the nature of your data, choosing a validation set can be the most important step. Although sklearn offers a train_test_split method, this method takes a random subset of the data, which is a poor choice for many real-world problems.”\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s the validation set explained, and created. What about the “test set” then – what’s that for?\nThe test set is yet another dataset that’s held out from training. But it’s held out from reporting metrics too! The accuracy of your model on the test set is only ever checked after you’ve completed your entire training process, including trying different models, training methods, data processing, etc.\nYou see, as you try all these different things, to see their impact on the metrics on the validation set, you might just accidentally find a few things that entirely coincidentally improve your validation set metrics, but aren’t really better in practice. Given enough time and experiments, you’ll find lots of these coincidental improvements. That means you’re actually over-fitting to your validation set!\nThat’s why we keep a test set held back. Kaggle’s public leaderboard is like a test set that you can check from time to time. But don’t check too often, or you’ll be even over-fitting to the test set!\nKaggle has a second test set, which is yet another held-out dataset that’s only used at the end of the competition to assess your predictions. That’s called the “private leaderboard”.\nWe’ll use eval as our name for the test set, to avoid confusion with the test dataset that was created above.\n\neval_df['input'] = 'TEXT1: ' + eval_df.context + '; TEXT2: ' + eval_df.target + '; ANC1: ' + eval_df.anchor\neval_ds = Dataset.from_pandas(eval_df).map(tok_func, batched=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we’re training a model, there will be one or more metrics that we’re interested in maximising or minimising. These are the measurements that should, hopefully, represent how well our model will works for us.\nIn real life, outside of Kaggle, things not easy… As my partner Dr Rachel Thomas notes in The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI:\n\nAt their heart, what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics. The practice of optimizing metrics is not new nor unique to AI, yet AI can be particularly efficient (even too efficient!) at doing so. This is important to understand, because any risks of optimizing metrics are heightened by AI. While metrics can be useful in their proper place, there are harms when they are unthinkingly applied. Some of the scariest instances of algorithms run amok all result from over-emphasizing metrics. We have to understand this dynamic in order to understand the urgent risks we are facing due to misuse of AI.\n\nIn Kaggle, however, it’s very straightforward to know what metric to use: Kaggle will tell you! According to this competition’s evaluation page, “submissions are evaluated on the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual similarity scores.” This coefficient is usually abbreviated using the single letter r. It is the most widely used measure of the degree of relationship between two variables.\nr can vary between -1, which means perfect inverse correlation, and +1, which means perfect positive correlation. The mathematical formula for it is much less important than getting a good intuition for what the different values look like. To start to get that intuition, let’s look at some examples using the California Housing dataset, which shows “is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars”. This dataset is provided by the excellent scikit-learn library, which is the most widely used library for machine learning outside of deep learning.\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nhousing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)\nhousing = housing['data'].join(housing['target']).sample(1000, random_state=52)\nhousing.head()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedInc\nHouseAge\nAveRooms\nAveBedrms\nPopulation\nAveOccup\nLatitude\nLongitude\nMedHouseVal\n\n\n\n\n7506\n3.0550\n37.0\n5.152778\n1.048611\n729.0\n5.062500\n33.92\n-118.28\n1.054\n\n\n4720\n3.0862\n35.0\n4.697897\n1.055449\n1159.0\n2.216061\n34.05\n-118.37\n3.453\n\n\n12888\n2.5556\n24.0\n4.864905\n1.129222\n1631.0\n2.395007\n38.66\n-121.35\n1.057\n\n\n13344\n3.0057\n32.0\n4.212687\n0.936567\n1378.0\n5.141791\n34.05\n-117.64\n0.969\n\n\n7173\n1.9083\n42.0\n3.888554\n1.039157\n1535.0\n4.623494\n34.05\n-118.19\n1.192\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n\n\n\n    \n      \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nWe can see all the correlation coefficients for every combination of columns in this dataset by calling np.corrcoef:\n\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)\n\nnp.corrcoef(housing, rowvar=False)\n\narray([[ 1.  , -0.12,  0.43, -0.08,  0.01, -0.07, -0.12,  0.04,  0.68],\n       [-0.12,  1.  , -0.17, -0.06, -0.31,  0.  ,  0.03, -0.13,  0.12],\n       [ 0.43, -0.17,  1.  ,  0.76, -0.09, -0.07,  0.12, -0.03,  0.21],\n       [-0.08, -0.06,  0.76,  1.  , -0.08, -0.07,  0.09,  0.  , -0.04],\n       [ 0.01, -0.31, -0.09, -0.08,  1.  ,  0.16, -0.15,  0.13,  0.  ],\n       [-0.07,  0.  , -0.07, -0.07,  0.16,  1.  , -0.16,  0.17, -0.27],\n       [-0.12,  0.03,  0.12,  0.09, -0.15, -0.16,  1.  , -0.93, -0.16],\n       [ 0.04, -0.13, -0.03,  0.  ,  0.13,  0.17, -0.93,  1.  , -0.03],\n       [ 0.68,  0.12,  0.21, -0.04,  0.  , -0.27, -0.16, -0.03,  1.  ]])\n\n\nThis works well when we’re getting a bunch of values at once, but it’s overkill when we want a single coefficient:\n\nnp.corrcoef(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)\n\narray([[1.  , 0.68],\n       [0.68, 1.  ]])\n\n\nTherefore, we’ll create this little function to just return the single number we need given a pair of variables:\n\ndef corr(x,y): return np.corrcoef(x,y)[0][1]\n\ncorr(housing.MedInc, housing.MedHouseVal)\n\n0.6760250732906\n\n\nNow we’ll look at a few examples of correlations, using this function (the details of the function don’t matter too much):\n\ndef show_corr(df, a, b):\n    x,y = df[a],df[b]\n    plt.scatter(x,y, alpha=0.5, s=4)\n    plt.title(f'{a} vs {b}; r: {corr(x, y):.2f}')\n\n\nshow_corr(housing, 'MedInc', 'MedHouseVal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s what a correlation of 0.68 looks like. It’s quite a close relationship, but there’s still a lot of variation. (Incidentally, this also shows why looking at your data is so important – we can see clearly in this plot that house prices above $500,000 seem to have been truncated to that maximum value).\nLet’s take a look at another pair:\n\nshow_corr(housing, 'MedInc', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship looks like it is similarly close to the previous example, but r is much lower than the income vs valuation case. Why is that? The reason is that there are a lot of outliers – values of AveRooms well outside the mean.\nr is very sensitive to outliers. If there’s outliers in your data, then the relationship between them will dominate the metric. In this case, the houses with a very high number of rooms don’t tend to be that valuable, so it’s decreasing r from where it would otherwise be.\nLet’s remove the outliers and try again:\n\nsubset = housing[housing.AveRooms&lt;15]\nshow_corr(subset, 'MedInc', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we expected, now the correlation is very similar to our first comparison.\nHere’s another relationship using AveRooms on the subset:\n\nshow_corr(subset, 'MedHouseVal', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this level, with r of 0.34, the relationship is becoming quite weak.\nLet’s look at one more:\n\nshow_corr(subset, 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you see here, a correlation of -0.2 shows a very weak negative trend.\nWe’ve seen now examples of a variety of levels of correlation coefficient, so hopefully you’re getting a good sense of what this metric means.\nTransformers expects metrics to be returned as a dict, since that way the trainer knows what label to use, so let’s create a function to do that:\n\ndef corr_d(eval_pred): return {'pearson': corr(*eval_pred)}\n\n\n\n\nTo train a model in Transformers we’ll need this:\n\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments,Trainer\n\nWe pick a batch size that fits our GPU, and small number of epochs so we can run experiments quickly:\n\nbs = 128\nepochs = 4\n\nThe most important hyperparameter is the learning rate. fastai provides a learning rate finder to help you figure this out, but Transformers doesn’t, so you’ll just have to use trial and error. The idea is to find the largest value you can, but which doesn’t result in training failing.\n\nlr = 8e-5\n\nTransformers uses the TrainingArguments class to set up arguments. Don’t worry too much about the values we’re using here – they should generally work fine in most cases. It’s just the 3 parameters above that you may need to change for different models.\n\nargs = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n    num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=0.01, report_to='none')\n\nWe can now create our model, and Trainer, which is a class which combines the data and model together (just like Learner in fastai):\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\ntrainer = Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                  tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr_d)\n\n\n\n\nSome weights of DebertaV2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v3-small and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pooler.dense.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias']\nYou should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n\n\nLet’s train our model!\n\ntrainer.train();\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/optimization.py:411: FutureWarning: This implementation of AdamW is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

The focus generally should be two things:\n\nCreating an effective validation set\nIterating rapidly to find changes which improve results on the validation set.\n\nIf you can do these two things, then you can try out lots of experiments and find what works, and what doesn’t. Without these two things, it will be nearly impossible to do well in a Kaggle competition (and, indeed, to create highly accurate models in real life!)\nThe more code you have, the more you have to maintain, and the more chances there are to make mistakes.

Note that pretrained models assume that text is tokenized in a particular way. In order to ensure that your tokenizer matches your model, use the AutoTokenizer, passing in your model name.\n\ntokz = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll need to combine the context, anchor, and target together somehow. There’s not much research as to the best way to do this, so we may need to iterate a bit. To start with, we’ll just combine them all into a single string. The model will need to know where each section starts, so we can use the special separator token to tell it:\n\nsep = tokz.sep_token\nsep\n\n'[SEP]'\n\n\n\ndf['inputs'] = df.context + sep + df.anchor + sep + df.target\n\nGenerally we’ll get best performance if we convert pandas DataFrames into HuggingFace Datasets, so we’ll convert them over, and also rename the score column to what Transformers expects for the dependent variable, which is label:\n\nds = Dataset.from_pandas(df).rename_column('score', 'label')\neval_ds = Dataset.from_pandas(eval_df)\n\nTo tokenize the data, we’ll create a function (since that’s what Dataset.map will need):\n\ndef tok_func(x): return tokz(x[\"inputs\"])\n\n\ntok_func(ds[0])\n\n{'input_ids': [1, 336, 5753, 2, 47284, 2, 47284, 265, 6435, 2], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nThe only bit we care about at the moment is input_ids. We can see in the tokens that it starts with a special token 1 (which represents the start of text), and then has our three fields separated by the separator token 2. We can check the indices of the special token IDs like so:\n\ntokz.all_special_tokens\n\n['[CLS]', '[SEP]', '[UNK]', '[PAD]', '[MASK]']\n\n\nWe can now tokenize the input. We’ll use batching to speed it up, and remove the columns we no longer need:\n\ninps = \"anchor\",\"target\",\"context\"\ntok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True, remove_columns=inps+('inputs','id','section'))\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the first item of the dataset we should see the same information as when we checked tok_func above:\n\ntok_ds[0]\n\n{'label': 0.5,\n 'input_ids': [1, 336, 5753, 2, 47284, 2, 47284, 265, 6435, 2],\n 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this post, the private test anchors do not overlap with the training set. So let’s do the same thing for our validation set.\nFirst, create a randomly shuffled list of anchors:\n\nanchors = df.anchor.unique()\nnp.random.seed(42)\nnp.random.shuffle(anchors)\nanchors[:5]\n\narray(['time digital signal', 'antiatherosclerotic', 'filled interior',\n       'dispersed powder', 'locking formation'], dtype=object)\n\n\nNow we can pick some proportion (e.g 25%) of these anchors to go in the validation set:\n\nval_prop = 0.25\nval_sz = int(len(anchors)*val_prop)\nval_anchors = anchors[:val_sz]\n\nNow we can get a list of which rows match val_anchors, and get their indices:\n\n# is_val is a boolean array\nis_val = np.isin(df.anchor, val_anchors)\nidxs = np.arange(len(df))\nval_idxs = idxs[ is_val]\ntrn_idxs = idxs[~is_val]\nlen(val_idxs),len(trn_idxs)\n\n(9116, 27357)\n\n\nOur training and validation Datasets can now be selected, and put into a DatasetDict ready for training:\n\ndds = DatasetDict({\"train\":tok_ds.select(trn_idxs),\n             \"test\": tok_ds.select(val_idxs)})\n\nBTW, a lot of people do more complex stuff for creating their validation set, but with a dataset this large there’s not much point. As you can see, the mean scores in the two groups are very similar despite just doing a random shuffle:\n\ndf.iloc[trn_idxs].score.mean(),df.iloc[val_idxs].score.mean()\n\n(0.3623021530138539, 0.3613426941641071)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now train our model! We’ll need to specify a metric, which is the correlation coefficient provided by numpy (we need to return a dictionary since that’s how Transformers knows what label to use):\n\ndef corr(eval_pred): return {'pearson': np.corrcoef(*eval_pred)[0][1]}\n\nWe pick a learning rate and batch size that fits our GPU, and pick a reasonable weight decay and small number of epochs:\n\nlr,bs = 8e-5,128\nwd,epochs = 0.01,4\n\nTransformers uses the TrainingArguments class to set up arguments. We’ll use a cosine scheduler with warmup, since at fast.ai we’ve found that’s pretty reliable. We’ll use fp16 since it’s much faster on modern GPUs, and saves some memory. We evaluate using double-sized batches, since no gradients are stored so we can do twice as many rows at a time.\n\ndef get_trainer(dds):\n    args = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n        num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\n    return Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                   tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\n\nargs = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n    num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n\nWe can now create our model, and Trainer, which is a class which combines the data and model together (just like Learner in fastai):\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\ntrainer = Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n               tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\n\n\n\n\ntrainer.train();\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:02, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.027171\n0.794542\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.026872\n0.811033\n\n\n3\n0.035300\n0.024633\n0.816882\n\n\n4\n0.035300\n0.024581\n0.817413\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now want to start iterating to improve this. To do that, we need to know whether the model gives stable results. I tried training it 3 times from scratch, and got a range of outcomes from 0.808-0.810. This is stable enough to make a start - if we’re not finding improvements that are visible within this range, then they’re not very significant! Later on, if and when we feel confident that we’ve got the basics right, we can use cross validation and more epochs of training.\nIteration speed is critical, so we need to quickly be able to try different data processing and trainer parameters. So let’s create a function to quickly apply tokenization and create our DatasetDict:\n\ndef get_dds(df):\n    ds = Dataset.from_pandas(df).rename_column('score', 'label')\n    tok_ds = ds.map(tok_func, batched=True, remove_columns=inps+('inputs','id','section'))\n    return DatasetDict({\"train\":tok_ds.select(trn_idxs), \"test\": tok_ds.select(val_idxs)})\n\n\ndef get_model(): return AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_nm, num_labels=1)\n\n\ndef get_trainer(dds, model=None):\n    if model is None: model = get_model()\n    args = TrainingArguments('outputs', learning_rate=lr, warmup_ratio=0.1, lr_scheduler_type='cosine', fp16=True,\n        evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\", per_device_train_batch_size=bs, per_device_eval_batch_size=bs*2,\n        num_train_epochs=epochs, weight_decay=wd, report_to='none')\n    return Trainer(model, args, train_dataset=dds['train'], eval_dataset=dds['test'],\n                   tokenizer=tokz, compute_metrics=corr)\n\nPerhaps using the special separator character isn’t a good idea, and we should use something we create instead. Let’s see if that makes things better. First we’ll change the separator and create the DatasetDict:\n\nsep = \" [s] \"\ndf['inputs'] = df.context + sep + df.anchor + sep + df.target\ndds = get_dds(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nget_trainer(dds).train()\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:27, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.027216\n0.799765\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.025568\n0.814325\n\n\n3\n0.031000\n0.023474\n0.817759\n\n\n4\n0.031000\n0.024206\n0.817377\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainOutput(global_step=856, training_loss=0.023552694610346144, metrics={'train_runtime': 207.9058, 'train_samples_per_second': 526.335, 'train_steps_per_second': 4.117, 'total_flos': 582121520370810.0, 'train_loss': 0.023552694610346144, 'epoch': 4.0})\n\n\nThat’s looking quite a bit better, so we’ll keep that change.\n(Vishal note: I trained it a few times but couldn’t get the pearson coefficient past 0.8174)\nOften changing to lowercase is helpful. Let’s see if that helps too:\n\ndf['inputs'] = df.inputs.str.lower()\ndds = get_dds(df)\nget_trainer(dds).train()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [755/856 02:53 &lt; 00:23, 4.33 it/s, Epoch 3.52/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.025207\n0.798847\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.024926\n0.813183\n\n\n3\n0.031800\n0.023556\n0.815640\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [856/856 03:17, Epoch 4/4]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\nPearson\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo log\n0.025207\n0.798847\n\n\n2\nNo log\n0.024926\n0.813183\n\n\n3\n0.031800\n0.023556\n0.815640\n\n\n4\n0.031800\n0.024359\n0.815295\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainOutput(global_step=856, training_loss=0.024133934595874536, metrics={'train_runtime': 197.3858, 'train_samples_per_second': 554.386, 'train_steps_per_second': 4.337, 'total_flos': 582121520370810.0, 'train_loss': 0.024133934595874536, 'epoch': 4.0})\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we made the patent section a special token? Then potentially the model might learn to recognize that different sections need to be handled in different ways. To do that, we’ll use, e.g. [A] for section A.

Create a function like the ones above to make that easy for you!\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes while watching this lesson’s video.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the book, we do NLP using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nIn the video, we’re going to be fine-tuning a pretrained NLP model using a library called HuggingFace Transformers.\nIt’s useful to have experience in using more than one library. See the same concepts applied in different ways. Great for understanding the concepts.\nHuggingFace libraries are SOTA in NLP.\nTransformers library in process of being integrated into fastai library.\nHuggingFace Transformers doesn’t have the same layered API as fastai.\n\nFine-Tuning a Pretrained Model\n\nIn the quadratic/sliders example, a pretrained model is like someone telling you that they are confident what parameter a should be, are somewhat confident what b should be, and have no idea what c should be. Then, we would train c until it firts our model, adjust b and keep a as is. That’s what it’s like fine-tuning a pretrained model.\nA pretrained model is a bunch of parameters have already been fit, where for some of them we’re pretty confident of what they should be, and for some of them we really have no idea at all.\nFine-tuning is the process of taking those ones where we have no idea at all what they should be and trying to get them right, and then moving the other ones a little bit.\n\nULMFiT\n\nThe idea of fine-tuning a pretrained NLP model was pioneered by ULMFiT which was first introduced in a fastai course, later turned into an academic paper by Jeremy and Sebastian Ruder which inspired a huge change in NLP capabilities around the world.\nStep 1\n\nBuild a language model using all of Wikipedia that tried to predict the next word of a Wikipedia article. Filling in these kinds of things requires understanding a lot about how language is structured and about the world. Getting good at fitting a language model requires a neural net getting good at a lot of things. It needs to understand language at a reasonably good level, what is true, what is not true, different ways in which things are expressed and so on. Started with random weights. At the end was a model that could predict more than 30% of the time correctly what the next word in a Wikipedia article would be.\n\nStep 2\n\nCreate a second language model, that predicts the next word of a sentence. Took the pretrained model and ran a few more epochs using IMDb movie reviews. So it got very good at predicting the next work of an IMDb movie review.\n\nStep 3\n\nTook those weights and fine-tuned them for the task of predicting whether or not a movie review was positive or negative sentiment.\n\n\nThe first two models don’t require labels. The labels was what’s the next word of the sentence.\nULMFiT built with RNNs.\nTransformers developed at the same time of ULMFiT’s release.\nTransformers can take advantage of modern accelerators like Google’s TPUs.\nTransformers don’t allow you to predict the next word of a sentence, it’s just not how they are structured. Instead they deleted at random a few words and asked the model to predict what words were deleted. The basic concept similar to ULMFiT ,replaced RNN with Transformer. Replaced language model with masked language model.\nHow do you go from a model that’s trained to predict the next word to a model that does classification?\n\nThe first layer of ImageNet classification model finds basic features like diagonal edges, gradients, etc. Layer two combined those (ReLUs added together, activations from sets of ReLUs matrix multipled, etc.)\nLayer 5 had bird and lizard eyeball detectors, dog face detectors, flowers detectors, etc.\nLater layers do things much more specific to the training task.\nPretty unlikely that you need to change the early layers.\nThe layer that says “what is this” is deleted in fine-tuning (the layer that has one output per category). The model is then spitting out a few hundred activations. We stick a new random matrix on top of that and train it, so it can predict what you’re trying to predict. Then we gradually train the rest of the layers.\n\nGetting started with NLP for absolute beginners\n\nUS Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching Competition.\nClassification is probably the most widely use case for NLP.\nDocument = an input to an NLP model that contains text.\nClassifying a document is a rich thing to do: sentiment analysis, author identifiation, legal discovery, organizing documents by topic, triaging inbound emails.\nThe Kaggle competition on US Patents does not immediately look like a classification problem.\nColumns: Anchor, target, context, score\nGoal: come up with a model that automatically determines which anchor and target pairs are talking about the same thing. score = 1.0 means the anchor and target mean the same thing, 0.0 means they are not.\nWhether the anchor and target are determined to be similar or not depends on the context.\nRepresent the problem as &lt;constant string&gt;&lt;anchor&gt;&lt;seperator&gt;&lt;constant string&gt;&lt;target&gt; and choose category 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00.\nKaggle data is already on Kaggle.\nAlways look through the competition’s Data page and read through it before jumping into the data.\nUse DataFrame.describe(include='object') to see stats about the fields (count, unique, top, frequency of top).\nThis dataset contains very small documents (3-4 words) that are not very unique. There’s not a lot of unique data to work with.\nCreate a single string of anchor, target, and context with separators and store as the input column.\nNeural networks work with numbers: We’re going to take the numbers, multiply by matrices, replace negatives with zeros, add them up, and do this a few times.\n\nTokenization: Split each document into tokens (words).\nThe list of unique words is called the vocabulary.\nNumericalization: Each word in the vocabulrary gets a number. The bigger the vocab, the more memory gets used, the more data we need to train. We don’t want a large vocabulary.\nTokenize into sub-words (pieces of words).\n\nWe can turn a pandas DataFrame into a Huggingface dataset’s Dataset using Dataset.from_pandas.\nWhatever pretrained model you used comes with a tokenizer. Before you start tokenizing, you have to decide on which model to use.\nHugginface Model Hub has pretrained models trained on specific corpuses.\nThere are some generally good models, deberta-v3 is one of those.\nNLP has been practically effective for general users for only a year or two, a lot of this stuff we’re figuring out as a community.\nAlways start with a small model, it’s faster to train, we’re going to be able to do more iterations.\nAutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&lt;model name&gt;) will download the vocab and details about how this particular model tokenized the dataset.\n_ represents the start of a word.\ndef tok_func(x): return tokx(x['input']) takes a document x, and tokenizes it’s input.\nDataset.map will parallelize the process of calling the function on each value. batched=True will do a bunch at a time. Tokenizer library is an optimized Rust library.\ninput_ids will contain numbers in the position of each of the tokens.\nHow do you choose the keywords and the order of the fields when creating input?\n\nIt’s arbitrary, try a few things. We just want something it can learn from that separates one field from another.\n\nIf one of the fields was long (1000 characters) is there any special handling required there?\n\nLong documents in ULMFiT require no special consideration. ULMFiT is the best approach for large documents. It will split large documents into pieces.\nLarge documents are challening for Transformers. It does the whole document at once.\nDocuments over 2000 words: look at ULMFiT.\nUnder 2000 words: Transformers should be fine unless you have a laptop GPU with not much memory.\n\nHuggingFace transformers expect that your target is a column called labels.\ntest.csv doesn’t have a score field.\nPerhaps the most important idea in machine learning is having separate training, validation and test datasets.\nTest and validation sets are all about identifying and controlling for overfitting.\nUnderfit: not enough complexity in the model fit to match the data that’s there. It’s systematically biased.\nCommon misunderstanding is that simpler models are more reliable in some way, but models that are too simple will be systematically incorrect.\nOverfit: it’s done a good job of fitting our data points, but if we sample some more data points from our distribution the model won’t be close to them.\nUnderfitting is easy to recognize (we can look at training data and see that it’s not very close).\nOverfitting is harder to recognize because the training data is very close.\nHow do we tell if we have a good fit that’s not overfitting? We measure how good our model is by looking ONLY at the points we set aside as the validation set.\nfast.ai won’t let you train a model without a validation set and shows metrics only on the validation set.\nCreating a good validation set is not generally as simple as just randomly pulling some of your data out of the data that you train your model on.\nKaggle is a great place to learn how to create a good validation set.\nA test set is another validation set that you don’t use for metrics. Helps you see if you overfit using the validation set.\nKaggle has two test sets: leaderboard feedback during competition and second test set that is private until after competition is finished.\nDon’t accidentally find a model that is good by coincidence. Only if you have a test set that you hold out will you know if you’ve done this.\nIf your model is terrible on the test set—go back to square one.\nYou don’t want functions with gradient of 0 of inf (like accuracy) you want something smooth.\nOne metric is not enough to capture all of the real world dynamics involved in a model’s use.\nGoodhart’s law: when a measure becomes a target, it’s ceases to be a good measure.\nAI is really good at optimizing metrics so you have to be careful what metrics you choose for models that are used in real life (impacting people’s lives).\nPearson correlation coefficient is the most widely used measure of how similar two variables are\n\n-1.0 to +1.0.\nAbbreviated as r.\n\nHow do I plot datasets with far too many points? The answer is: get less points (sample).\nnp.corrcoef gives a diagonally symmetric matrix of r values.\nVisualizing your data is important so you can see things like how data is truncated.\nalpha=0.5 for scatter plots creates darker areas where there’s lots of dots.\nr relies on the square of the difference, big outliers increase that by a lot.\nr is very sensitive to outliers.\nIf you’re trying to win a Kaggle competition that uses r and even a couple of your rows are really wrong, it will be a disaster.\nYou almost can’t see the relationship for \\(r=0.34\\)\nTransformers expects metric to be returned as a dict.\ntok_ds.train_test_split() returns a DatasetDict({train: Dataset, test: Dataset}).\nTransformers calls it validation set test, on which is calculates metrics.\nThe fastai equivalent of Learner is the HuggingFace Transformer’s Trainer.\nThe larger the batch size, the more you can do in parallel and the faster it’ll be, but if it’s too large you’ll get an out-of-memory error on the GPU.\nIf you’re using a framework that doesn’t have a learning rate finder like fastai, you can just start with a really low learning rate and then keep doubling it until it falls apart.\nTrainingArguments is a class that takes all of the configuration (like learning rate, warmup ratio, scheduler type, weight decay, etc.).\nYou always want fp16=True as it will be faster.\nAutoModelForSequenceClassification will create an model for classification, .from_pretrained will use a pretrained model which has a num_labels param which is the number of output columns we have, which in this case is 1 (the score).\nTrainer takes the model, the training and validation data, TrainingArguments(), tokenizer and metrics).\nTrainer.train() will train the model.\nHuggingFace is very verbose, the warnings which you can ignore.\nThe only reason we get a high r value after 4 epochs is because we used a pretrained model.\nThe pretrained model already knows a lot about language and has a good sense of whether two phrases have the same meaning or not.\nHow do you decide when it’s okay to remove outliers?\n\nOutliers should never just be removed for modelling.\nInstead we would observe that clearly from looking at this dataset, these two groups can’t be treated the same way (low income/high # of rooms vs. high income/high # of rooms). Split them into two separate analyses.\nOutlier exists in a statistical sense, it doesn’t exist in a real sense (i.e. things that we should ignore or throw away). Some of the most useful insights in data projects are digging into outliers and understanding what are they? and where did they come from? It’s in those edge cases where you discover really important things like when processes go wrong, labelling problems. Never delete outliers. Investigate them, have a strategy about what you’re going to do with them.\n\nTraining with HuggingFace’s Transformer is similar to the things we’ve seen before with fastai.\ntrainer.predict(eval_ds).predictions.astype(float) to get predictions from Trainer object.\nAlways look at your outputs. So you can see things like having negative predictions or predictions over 1, which are outside the range of the patent phrase matching score. For now, we can at least round these off up to 0 and down to 1, respectively, better ways to do this but this is better than nothing.\nKaggle expects submissions to generally be in a CSV file.\nNLP is probably where the biggest opportunities are for big wins in research and commercialization.\n\nIt’s worth thinking about both use and misuse of modern NLP.\nYou can create bots to generate context appropriate conversation and scale it up to 99% of Twitter and nobody would know. This is worrying because a lot of how people see the world is coming out of social media conversation, which at this point are contrallable. It would not be that hard to create something that’s optimized towards moving a point of view amongst a billion people in a very subtle way, very gradually over a long period of time by multiple bots each pretending to argue with each other and one of them getting the upper hand and so forth.\nWhat GPT is used for we may not know for decades, if ever.\n2017: millions of submissions to the FTC about Net Neutrality very heavily biased against it. An analysis showed that something like 99% of them were auto-generated. We don’t know for sure but this seems successful because repealing Net Neutrality went through, the comments were factored into this decision.\nYou can always create a generative model that beats bot classifiers designed to classify its content as auto-generated. Similar problem with spam prevention.\nIf you pass num_labels=1 to AutoModelForSequenceClassification it treats it as a regression problem.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I’ll take notes and run code examples from Chapter 10: NLP Deep Dive: RNNs in the textbook.\n\nIn general, in NLP the pretrained model is trained on a different task.\nlanguage model: a model that has been trained to guess the next word in a text (having read the ones before).\nself-supervised learning: Training a model using labels that are embedded in the independent variable, rather than requiring external labels.\nTo properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the natural language.\nSelf-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning.\nSelf-supervised learning and computer vision\nEven if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting.\nYou get even better results if you fine-tune the sequence-based language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model.\nThe IMDb dataset contains 100k movie reviews (50k unlabeled, 25k labeled training set reviews, 25k labeled validation set reviews). We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles, this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review. This is known as Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT).\nThe extra stage of fine-tuning the language model, prior to transfer learning to classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions.\n\n\n\n\nUsing categorical variables as independent variables for a neural network:\n\nMake a list of all possible levels of that categorical variable (the vocab).\nReplace each level with its index in the vocab.\nCreate an embedding matrix for this containing a row for each level (i.e., for each item of the vocab).\nUse this embedding matrix as the first layer of a neural network. (A dedicated embedding matrix can take as inputs the raw vocab indexes created in step 2; this is equivalent to, but faster and more efficient than, a matrix that takes as input one-hot-encoded vectors representing the indexes).\n\nWe can do nearly the same thing with text:\n\nFirst we concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one big long string and split it into words (or tokens), giving us a very long list of words.\nOur independent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the first word in our very long list and ending with the second to last, and our dependent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the second word and ending with the last word.\nOur vocab will consist of a mix of common words that are already in the vocabulary of our pretrained model and new words specific to our corpus.\nOur embedding matrix will be built accordingly: for words that are in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, we will take the corresponding row in the embedding matrix of the pretrained model; but for new words, we won’t have anything, so we will just initialize the corresponding row with a random vector.\n\nSteps for creating a language model:\n\nTokenization: convert the text into a list of words (or characters, or substrings, depending on the granularity of your model)\nNumericalization: List all of the unique words that appear (vocab) and convert each word into a number by looking up its index in the vocab.\nLanguage model data loader creation: fastai’s LMDataLoader automatically handles creating a dependent variable that is offset from the independent variable by one token, and handles important details liks shuffling the training data so that the dependent and independent variables maintain their structure as required.\nLanguage model creation: we need a model that handles input lists that could be arbitrarily big or small. We use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).\n\n\n\n\nThere is no one approach to tokenization. There are three main approaches:\n\nWord-based: Split a sentence on spaces and separate parts of meaning even when there are no spaces (“don’t” -&gt; “do n’t”). Punctuation marks are generally split into separate tokens.\nSubword based: Split words into smaller parts, based on the most commonly occurring substrings (“occasion” -&gt; “o c ca sion”).\nCharacter-based: Split a sentence into its individual characters.\n\n\n\n\nRather than providing its own tokenizers, fastai provides a consistent interface to a range of tokenizers in external libraries.\nLet’s try it out with the IMDb dataset:\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\npath = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [144441344/144440600 00:02&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#7) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_lm'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/imdb.vocab'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/test'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_clas'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/README')]\n\n\nget_text_files gets all the text files in a path\n\nfiles = get_text_files(path, folders = ['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\n\n\nfiles[:10]\n\n(#10) [Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/42765_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/19120_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/8649_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/32022_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/30143_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/14876_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/28162_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/32133_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/21844_0.txt'),Path('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup/830_0.txt')]\n\n\nHere’s a review that we will tokenize:\n\ntxt = files[0].open().read(); txt[:75]\n\n\"Despite some humorous banter and a decent supporting cast, I can't really r\"\n\n\nWordTokenizer will always point to fastai’s current default word tokenizer.\nfastai’s coll_repr(collection, n) displays the first n items of collection, along with the full size.\n\ntokz = WordTokenizer()\ntoks = first(tokz([txt]))\nprint(coll_repr(toks, 30))\n\n(#243) ['Despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','I','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','The','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','I','did',\"n't\",'particularly','care'...]\n\n\nTokenization is a surprisingly subtle task. “.” is separated when it terminates a sentence but not in an acronym or number:\n\nfirst(tokz(['The U.S. dollar $1 is $1.00.']))\n\n(#9) ['The','U.S.','dollar','$','1','is','$','1.00','.']\n\n\nfastai adds some functionality to the tokenization process with the Tokenizer class:\n\ntkn = Tokenizer(tokz)\nprint(coll_repr(tkn(txt), 31))\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','i','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','xxmaj','the','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','i','did',\"n't\"...]\n\n\nTokens that start with xx are special tokens.\nxxbos is a special token that indicates the start of a new text (“BOS” is a standard NLP acronym that means “beginning of stream”). By recognizing this start token, the model will be able to learn it needs to “forget” what was said previously and focus on upcoming words. These special tokens don’t come from the external tokenizer. fastai adds them by default by applying a number of rules when processing text. These rules are designed to make it easier for a model to recognize the important parts of a sentence. We are translating the original English language sequence into a simplified tokenized language that is designed to be easy for a model to learn.\nFor example, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a single exclamation point follow by a special repeated character token and then the number four.\n\ntkn('!!!!')\n\n(#4) ['xxbos','xxrep','4','!']\n\n\nIn this way, the model’s embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repititions of every punctuation mark. A capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word so the embedding matrix needs only the lowercase version of the words saving compute and memory resources but can still learn the concept of capitalization.\nHere are some of the main special tokens:\nxxbos: Indicates the beginning of a text (in this case, a review).\nxxmaj: Indicates the next word begins with a capital.\nxxunk: Indicates the next word is unknown.\n\ndefaults.text_proc_rules\n\n[&lt;function fastai.text.core.fix_html(x)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_rep(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_wrep(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.spec_add_spaces(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.rm_useless_spaces(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_all_caps(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.replace_maj(t)&gt;,\n &lt;function fastai.text.core.lowercase(t, add_bos=True, add_eos=False)&gt;]\n\n\nfix_html: replaces special HTML characters with a readable version.\nreplace_rep: Replaces any character repeated three times or more with a special token for repetition (xxrep), the number of times it’s repeated, then the character.\nreplace_wrep: Replaces any word repeated three times or more with a special token for word repetition (xxwrep), the number of times it’s repeated, then the character.\nspec_add_spaces: adds spaces around / and #.\nrm_useless_spaces: Removes all repetitions of the space character.\nreplace_all_caps: Lowercases a word written in all caps and adds a special token for all caps (xxcap) in front of it.\nreplace_maj: Lowercases a capitalized word and adds a special token for capitalized (xxmaj) in front of it.\nlowercase: Lowercases all text and adds a special token at the beginning (xxbos) and/or the end (xxeos).\n\ncoll_repr(tkn(\"&copy;    Fast.ai www.fast.ai/INDEX\"), 31)\n\n\"(#11) ['xxbos','©','xxmaj','fast.ai','xxrep','3','w','.fast.ai','/','xxup','index']\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWord tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However this assumption is not always appropriate. Languages like Chinese and Japanese don’t use spaces. Turkish and Hungarian can add many subwords together without spaces.\nTwo steps of subword tokenization:\n\nAnalyze a corpus of documents to find the most commonly occuring groups of letters. These becomes the vocab.\nTokenize the corpus string using this vocab of subword units.\n\n\ntxts = L(o.open().read() for o in files[:2000])\n\n\n! pip install sentencepiece\ndef subword(sz):\n  sp = SubwordTokenizer(vocab_sz=sz)\n  sp.setup(txts)\n  return ' '.join(first(sp([txt]))[:40])\n\nsetup reads the documents and finds the common sequences of characters to create the vocab.\n\nsubword(1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"▁De s p ite ▁some ▁humor ous ▁b ant er ▁and ▁a ▁de cent ▁support ing ▁cast , ▁I ▁can ' t ▁really ▁recommend ▁this ▁movie . ▁The ▁lead s ▁are n ' t ▁very ▁li k able ▁and ▁I\"\n\n\nWhen using fastai’s subword tokenizer, _ represents a space character in the original text.\nIf we use a smaller vocab, each token will represent fewer characters and it will take more tokens to represent a sentence.\n\nsubword(200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'▁ D es p it e ▁ s o m e ▁h u m or o us ▁b an ter ▁and ▁a ▁ d e c ent ▁ s u p p or t ing ▁ c a s t'\n\n\nIf we use a larger vocab, most common English words will end up in the vocab themselves, and we will not need as many to represent a sentence:\n\nsubword(10000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"▁Des pite ▁some ▁humorous ▁ban ter ▁and ▁a ▁decent ▁support ing ▁cast , ▁I ▁can ' t ▁really ▁recommend ▁this ▁movie . ▁The ▁leads ▁are n ' t ▁very ▁likable ▁and ▁I ▁didn ' t ▁particular ly ▁care ▁if ▁they\"\n\n\nA larger vocab means fewer tokens per sentence, which means faster training, less memory and less state for the model to remember; but on the downside, it means larger embedding matricces, which require more data to learn.\nSubword tokenization provides a way to easily scale between character tokenization (using a small subword vocab) and word tokenization (using a large subword vocab) and handles every human language. It can even handle genomic sequences or MIDI music notation. It’s likely to become (or has already) the most common tokenization approach.\n\n\n\nNumericalization is the process of mapping tokens to integers.\n\nMake a list of all possible levels of the categorical variable (the vocab).\nReplace each level with its index in the vocab.\n\n\ntoks = tkn(txt)\nprint(coll_repr(tkn(txt), 31))\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting','cast',',','i','ca',\"n't\",'really','recommend','this','movie','.','xxmaj','the','leads','are',\"n't\",'very','likable','and','i','did',\"n't\"...]\n\n\nJust like with SubwordTokenizer, we need to call setup on Numericalize to create the vocab. That means we’ll need our tokenized corpus first:\n\ntoks200 = txts[:200].map(tkn)\ntoks200[0]\n\n(#264) ['xxbos','xxmaj','despite','some','humorous','banter','and','a','decent','supporting'...]\n\n\n\nnum = Numericalize()\nnum.setup(toks200)\ncoll_repr(num.vocab, 20)\n\n\"(#2200) ['xxunk','xxpad','xxbos','xxeos','xxfld','xxrep','xxwrep','xxup','xxmaj','the','.',',','and','a','of','to','is','in','i','it'...]\"\n\n\nOur special rules tokens appear first, and then every word appears once in frequency order.\nThe defaults to Numericalize are min_freq=3 and max_vocab=60000. max_vocab results in fastai replacing all words other than the most common 60,000 with a special unknown word token, xxunk. This is useful to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, since that can slow down training and use up too much memory, and can also mean that there isn’t enough data to train useful representations for rare words (better handles by setting min_freq, any word appearing fewer than it is replaced with xxunk).\nfastai can also numericalize your dataset using a vocab that you provide, by passing a list of words as the vocab parameter.\nThe Numericalizer object is used like a function:\n\nnums = num(toks)[:20]; nums\n\nTensorText([  2,   8, 418,  68,   0,   0,  12,  13, 618, 419, 190,  11,  18,\n            259,  38,  93, 445,  21,  28,  10])\n\n\nWe can check that the integers map back to the original text:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in nums)\n\n\"xxbos xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want our language model to read text in order, so that it can efficiently predict what the next word is, this means each new batch should begin precisely where the previous one left off.\nAt the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the order of the documents to make a new stream.\nWe then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our batch size). For example, if the stream has 50,000 tokens as we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000…) because we want the model to read continuous rows of text. An xxbos token is added at the start of each text during preprocessing, so that the model knowns when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\nFirst apply our Numericalize object to the tokenized texts:\n\nnums200 = toks200.map(num)\n\nThen pass it to the LMDataLoader:\n\ndl = LMDataLoader(nums200)\n\n\nx,y = first(dl)\nx.shape, y.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 72]), torch.Size([64, 72]))\n\n\n\nx[:1], y[:1]\n\n(LMTensorText([[   2,    8,  418,   68,    0,    0,   12,   13,  618,  419,  190,\n                  11,   18,  259,   38,   93,  445,   21,   28,   10,    8,    9,\n                 693,   42,   38,   72, 1274,   12,   18,   81,   38,  479,  420,\n                  58,   47,  305,  274,   17,    9,  135,   10,   18,  619,   81,\n                  38,   49,    9,  221,  120,  221,   47,  305,  274,   11,   29,\n                   8,    0,    8, 1275,  783,   74,   59,  446,   15,   43,    9,\n                   0,  285,  114,    0,   24,    0]]),\n TensorText([[   8,  418,   68,    0,    0,   12,   13,  618,  419,  190,   11,\n                18,  259,   38,   93,  445,   21,   28,   10,    8,    9,  693,\n                42,   38,   72, 1274,   12,   18,   81,   38,  479,  420,   58,\n                47,  305,  274,   17,    9,  135,   10,   18,  619,   81,   38,\n                49,    9,  221,  120,  221,   47,  305,  274,   11,   29,    8,\n                 0,    8, 1275,  783,   74,   59,  446,   15,   43,    9,    0,\n               285,  114,    0,   24,    0,   30]]))\n\n\nLooking at the first row of the independent variable:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in x[0][:20])\n\n\"xxbos xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie .\"\n\n\nWhich is the start of the text.\nThe dependent variable is the same thing offset by one token:\n\n' '.join(num.vocab[o] for o in y[0][:20])\n\n\"xxmaj despite some xxunk xxunk and a decent supporting cast , i ca n't really recommend this movie . xxmaj\"\n\n\nWe are now ready to train our text classifier.\n\n\n\n\nTwo steps to training a state-of-the-art text classifier using transfer learning:\n\nFine-tune our language model pretrained on Wikipedia to the corpus of IMDb reviews.\nUse that model to train a classifier.\n\n\n\nfastai handles tokenization and numericalization automatically when TextBlock is passed to DataBlock.\n\nget_imdb = partial(get_text_files, folders=['train', 'test', 'unsup'])\n\ndls_lm = DataBlock(\n    blocks=TextBlock.from_folder(path, is_lm=True),\n    get_items=get_imdb,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(0.1)\n).dataloaders(path, path=path, bs=128, seq_len=80)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom_folder tells TextBlock how to access the texts so that it can do initial preprocessing. fastai performs a few optmizations:\n\nIt saves the tokenized documents in a temporary folder, so it doesn’t have to tokenize them more than once.\nIt runs multiple tokenization processes in parallel, to take advantage of your computer’s CPUs.\n\n\ndls_lm.show_batch(max_n=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\ntext_\n\n\n\n\n0\nxxbos xxmaj caught this at xxmaj cinequest . xxmaj it was well attended , but the crowd seemed disappointed . xxmaj in my humble opinion , \" charlie the xxmaj ox \" was very amateurish and overrated ( it pales in comparison with other cinequest pics i saw ) . xxmaj acting ( with the exception of xxmaj polito ) seemed self -

The second batch’s first mini-stream is a continuation of the first batch’s first mini-stream. In this case, the first mini-stream of the second batch also contains the start of the next movie review (document) as indicated by the xxbos special token.\n\n\n\nTo convert the integer word indices into activations that we can use for our neural network, we will use embeddings. We feed those embeddings into a recurrent neural network (RNN) using an architecture called AWS-LSTM.\nThe embeddings in the pretrained model are merged with random embeddings added for words that weren’t in the pretraining vocabulary.\n\nlearn = language_model_learner(\n    dls_lm,\n    AWD_LSTM,\n    drop_mult=0.3,\n    metrics=[accuracy, Perplexity()]\n).to_fp16()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [105070592/105067061 00:00&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\nThe loss function used by default is cross-entropy loss, since we essentially have a classification problem (the different categories being the words in our vocab).\nPerplexity is a metric often used in NLP for language models. It is the exponential of loss (i.e., torch.exp(cross_entropy)).\nlanguage_model_learner automatically calls freeze when using a pretrained model (which is the default) so this will train only the embeddings (the part of the model that contains randomly initialized weights—embeddings for the words that are in our IMDb vocab, but aren’t in the pretrained model vocab).\nI wasn’t able to train my model on Google Colab (I got a ran out of memory error even for small batches) so I trained the IMDb language model on Paperspace and wrote a separate blog post about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven simple algorithms could be used to create fraudulent accounts and try to influence policymakers (99% of the 2017 Net Neutrality public comments were likely faked).\nMany people assume or hope that algorithms will come to our defense here, the problem is that this will always be an arms race, in which better classification (or discriminator) algorithms can be used to create better generation algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n1. What is self-supervised learning?\nSelf-supervised learning is when you train a model on data that does not contain any external labels. Instead, the labels are embedded in the independent variable.\n2. What is a language model?\nA language model is a model that predicts the next word based on the previous words in a text.\n3. Why is a language model considered self-supervised?\nBecause we do not train the model with external labels. The dependent variable is the next token in a sequence of previous tokens (independent variable).\n4. What are self-supervised models usually used for?\nPretraining a model that will be used for transfer learning.\n5. Why do we fine-tune language models?\nIn order for it to learn the style of language used in our specific corpus.\n6. What are the three steps to create a state-of-the-art text classifier?\n\nTrain a language model on a large general corpus like Wikipedia.\nFine-tune a language model using your task-specific corpus.\nFine-tune a classifier using the encoder of the twice-pretrained language model.\n\n7. How do the 50,000 unlabeled movie reviews help create a better text classifier for the IMDb dataset?\nThe 50k unlabeled movie reviews help create a better text classifier for the IMDb dataset because when you fine-tune the pretrained Wikipedia language model using this data, the model learns the particular style and content of IMDb movie reviews, which helps it better understand what the language used in the reviews means when classifying it as positive or negative.\n8. What are the three steps to prepare your data for a language model?\n\nTokenization: convert the text into a list of words (or characters or substrings).\nNumericalization: List all of the words that appear (the vocab) and convert each word into a number by looking up its index in the vocab.\nLanguage model data loader creation: combine the documents into one string and split it into fixed sequence length batches while preserving the order of the tokens, create a dependent variable that is offset from the independent variable by one token, and shuffle the training data (maintaining independent/dependent variable structure).\n\n9. What is tokenization? Why do we need it?\nTokenization is the conversion of text into smaller parts (like words, subwords or characters). In order to convert our documents into numbers (categories) that the language model can learn something about, we first tokenize them (break them into smaller parts) so that we can generate a list of unique tokens (unique levels of a categorical variable) contained in the corpus (categorical variable).\n10. Name three approaches to tokenization.\n\nword-based: split a sentence based on spaces.\nsubword based: split words into commonly occurring substrings.\ncharacter-based: split a sentence into its individual characters.\n\n11. What is xxbos?\nA special token that tells the language model that we are at the start of a new stream (document).\n12. List four rules that fastai applies to text during tokenization.\nI’ll list them all:\n\nfix_html: replace special HTML characters (like &copy—the copyright symbol) with a readable version.\nreplace_rep: replace repeated characters with a special token for repetition (xxrep), the number of times it’s repeated, and then the character.\nreplace_wrep: do the same as replace_rep but for repeated words (using the special token xxwrep).\nspec_add_spaces: add spaces around / and #.\nrm_useless_spaces: remove all repetitions of the space character.\nreplace_all_caps: lowercase all-caps words and place a special token xxcap in front of it.\nreplace_maj: lowercase a capitalized word and place a special token xxmaj in front of it.\nlowercase: lowercase all text and place a special token at the beginning (xxbos) and/or at the end (xxeos).\n\n13. Why are repeated characters replaced with a token showing the number of repetitions and the character that’s repeated?\nSo that the model’s embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation without requiring a unique token for every number of repetitions of a character.\n14. What is numericalization?\nConverting a token to a number by looking up its index in the vocab (unique list of all tokens).\n15. Why might there be words that are replaced with the “unknown word” token?\nIn order to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, fastai’s numericalization replaces two types of words with with the unknown word token xxunk:\n\nWords that appear less than min_freq times.\nWords that are not in the max_vocab most frequent words.\n\nFor example, if min_freq = 3 then all words that appear once or twice are replaced with xxunk.\nIf max_vocab = 60000 then words the appear less frequently than the 60000th most frequent word are replaced with xxunk.\n16. With a batch size of 64, the first row of the tensor representing the first batch contains the first 64 tokens for the dataset. What does the second row of that tensor contain?\nThe second row contains 64 tokens of the (n/b/s+1)th group of tokens where n is the number of tokens, divided by the number of batches b divided by the sequence length s. So, if we have 90 tokens divided into 6 batches (rows) with a sequence length (columns) of 5, then the second row of the first batch contains the 4th (i.e., 3 + 1) group of tokens.\nPutting Tanishq’s answer here as well:\n\nThe dataset is split into 64 mini-streams (batch size).\nEach batch has 64 rows (batch size) and 64 columns (sequence length).\nThe first row of the first batch contains the beginning of the first mini-stream (tokens 1-64).\nThe second row of the first batch contains the beginning of the second mini-stream.\nThe first row of the second batch contains the second chunk of the first mini-stream (tokens 65 - 128).\n\n17. Why do we need padding for text classification? Why don’t we need it for language modeling?\nWhen the data is prepared for language modeling, the documents are concatenated into a single string and broken up into equally-sized batches, so there is no need to pad any batches—they’re already the right size.\nIn the case of text classification, each document is maintained in full length in a batch, and documents will very likely have a varying number of tokens (i.e., everyone is not writing the same length of movie reviews with the same number of special tokens) so in each batch, all of the documents (except the largest) will need to be padded to the batch’s largest document’s size. fastai sorts the data by length each epoch and groups together documents of similar lengths for each batch before applying the padding.\nSomething that I would like to understand however is:\nWhat if the number of tokens in the training dataset is not divisible by the selected batch size and sequence length? Does fastai use padding in that case? Suppose you have 1000 tokens in total, a batch size of 16 and sequence length of 20. 320 goes into 1000 3 times with a remainder. Does fastai create a 4th batch with padding? Or remove the tokens so there’s only 3 batches? I’ll see if I can figure out what it does with some sample code:\n\nbs,sl = 5, 2\nints = L([[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]]).map(tensor)\n\n\ndl = LMDataLoader(ints, bs=bs, seq_len=sl)\n\nlist(dl)\n\n[(LMTensorText([[0, 1],\n                [2, 3],\n                [4, 5],\n                [6, 7],\n                [8, 9]]),\n  tensor([[ 1,  2],\n          [ 3,  4],\n          [ 5,  6],\n          [ 7,  8],\n          [ 9, 10]]))]\n\n\n\nlist(LMDataLoader(ints, bs=bs, seq_len=sl, drop_last=False))\n\n[(LMTensorText([[0, 1],\n                [2, 3],\n                [4, 5],\n                [6, 7],\n                [8, 9]]),\n  tensor([[ 1,  2],\n          [ 3,  4],\n          [ 5,  6],\n          [ 7,  8],\n          [ 9, 10]]))]\n\n\nLooks like fastai drops the last batch if it’s not full. I’ve posted this question in the fastai forums to get a confirmation on my understanding.\n18. What does an embedding matrix for NLP contain? What is its shape?\nIt contains the parameters that are trained by the neural net, with each parameter corresponding to each token in the vocab.\nFrom Tanishq’s solutions:\n\nThe embedding matrix has the size (vocab_size x embedding_size) where vocab_size is the length of the vocabulary, and embedding_size is an arbitrary number defining the number of latent factors of the tokens.\n\n19. What is perplexity?\nA metric used in NLP. It is the exponential of the loss.\n20. Why do we have to pass the vocabulary of the language model to the classifier data block?\nThe indexes corresponding to the tokens have to be maintained because we are fine-tuning the language model.\n21. What is gradual unfreezing?\nWhen we train one layer at a time for one epoch before we unfreeze and train the full model (including all layers of the encoder).\n22. Why is text generation always likely to be ahead of automatic identification of machine-generated texts?\nBecause text generation models can be trained to beat automatic identification algorithms.\n\n\n\n1. See what you can learn about language models and disinformation. What are the best language models today? Take a look at some of their outputs. Do you find them convincing? How could a bad actor best use such a model to create conflict and uncertainty?\n\nHere is a tweet thread by Arvind Narayan talking about how the danger of ChatGPT is that “you can’t tell when it’s wrong unless you already know the answer”.\nThis New York Times article walks through different examples of ChatGPT responding to prompts with disinformation.\nThis NewsGuard article, which was referenced in the NYT article, discusses how ChatGPT-4 is more prone to perpetuating misinformation than its predecessor GPT-3.5. GPT-3.5 generated 80 of 100 false narratives given as prompts while GPT-4 generated 100 of 100 false narratives. Also, “ChatGPT-4’s responses that contained false and misleading claims were less likely to include disclaimers about the falsity of those claims (23% of the time) [than ChatGPT-3.5 (51% of the time)].\nThis NBC New York article walks through an example of how a ChatGPT written story on Michael Bloomberg was full of made-up quotes and sources. It also talks about how some educators are embracing ChatGPT in the classroom, and while ineffective, there are machine-generated text identification algorithms available. Although it’s important to note, as disussed in the fastai course, that text generation models will always be ahead of automatic identification models (generative models can be trained to beat identification models).\nIn this Harvard Business School Working Knowledge article Scott Van Voorhiss and Tsedal Neeley summarise the story of how Dr. Timnit Gebru went from Ethiopia, to Boston, to a PhD at Stanford, and co-lead of Google AI Ethics, later to be fired when because she co-authored a paper that asked for companies to hold off on building large language models until we figured out how to handle the bias perpetuated by these models.\n\nThe article’s authors use these events as a case study to learn from when handling issues of ethics in AI.\n\n“The biggest message I want to convey is that AI can scale bias in ways that we can barely understand today”.\n“in failing to give Gebru the independence to do her job, might have sacrificed an opportunity to become a global leader in responsible AI development”.\nFinally, in this paper the authors test detection tools for AI-generated text in academic settings. “The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated text”. Across the 14 tools, the highest average accuracy was less than 80%, with 50% for AI-generated/human-edited text and 26% for machine-paraphrased AI-generated text.\n\n2. Given the limitation that models are unlikely to be able to consistently recognize machine-generated texts, what other approaches may be needed to handle large-scale disinformation campaigns that leverage deep learning?\nThe first thing that comes to mind is Glaze by the University of Chicago which “works by understanding the AI models that are training on human art, and using machine learning algorithms, computing a set of minimal changes to artworks, such that it appears unchanged to human eyes, but appears to AI models like a dramatically different art style…So when someone then prompts the model to generate art mimicking the charcoal artist, they will get something quite different from what they expected.”\nI can’t imagine how something analogous to Glaze can be created for language, since plain text is just plain text, but conceptually, if human-written language is altered in a similar way, then it will be prevented from being generated similarly by LLMs like GPT. This would effect not just LLMs but anyone training their model on such altered data, but perhaps that is a cost worth having to prevent the perpetuation of copyrighted or disinformation content.\nAnother idea is that disinformation detection may benefit from a human-in-the-loop. AI-generated content that is not identified automatically may be identified by a human as disinformation. A big enough sample of accounts spreading this misinformation may lead to identifying broader trends in which accounts are fake."

    "text": "In the fastai course Part 1 Lesson 6 video Jeremy Howard walked through the notebooks First Steps: Road to the Top, Part 1 and Small models: Road to the Top, Part 2 where he builds increasingly accurate solutions to the Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification Kaggle Competition. In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition. I’m excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\nIn this blog post series, I’ll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way. My last two blog posts in this series reference Jeremy’s Scaling Up: Road to the Top, Part 3 notebook to improve my large model ensemble predictions. Here are the links to each of the blog posts in this series:\n\nPart 1: Live Coding 8\nPart 2: Live Coding 9\nPart 3: Live Coding 10\nPart 4: Live Coding 11\nPart 5: Live Coding 12 (You are here)\nPart 6: Live Coding 13\nPart 7: Improving My Large Ensemble, Part 1\nPart 8: Improving My Large Ensemble, Part 2\n\nLink to Live Coding 12 video\n\n\n\n!pip install -qq timm==0.6.13\nimport timm\ntimm.__version__\n\n'0.6.13'\n\n\n\n# install fastkaggle if not available\ntry: import fastkaggle\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError:\n    !pip install -Uq fastkaggle\n\nfrom fastkaggle import *\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\ncomp = 'paddy-disease-classification'\npath = setup_comp(comp, install='fastai')\n\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version &gt;=1.16.5 and &lt;1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.24.3\n  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version &gt;={np_minversion} and &lt;{np_maxversion}\"\n\n\n\npath.ls()\n\n(#4) [Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/sample_submission.csv'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train_images'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/train.csv'),Path('../input/paddy-disease-classification/test_images')]\n\n\n\ntrn_path = path/'train_images'\n\n\n\n\nOn PETS, in the top 15, you have a bit of everything (resnetrs, resnetv2, vit, swin, resnet26d, regnet, convnext). The larger vit models only work on larger images. Pleasantly surprised to see some of the vit’s didn’t use much memory and they were pretty fast. resnetrs is small and fast.\nOn PLANET, it doesn’t look that different except it’s entirely vit, swin and convnext in the top 15. vit_small_patch32_224’s memory usage is amazing.\nRunning these models took less than 3 hours on Jeremy’s three GPUs. 1200 runs.\nWhen to use larger images? Do everything you can on smaller images, as long as it gets you reasonable results, because you want to iterate quickly. Then, when you want the best accuracy you try bigger and bigger images and see what you can get away with–keep doing that as long as the accuracy improves. In a production environment it’s similar, you make it bigger and bigger until the latency of the model is too high, and you find the right trade-off between model latency and accuracy. Generally speaking, larger images will give you more accurate results but a lot slower (you end up with a lot more pixels from 224^2 to 360^2). For initial iterating you don’t need a really accurate model because you are trying to figure out what data preprocessing works best, or what architecture works best. In a business context, Jeremy would do exactly what he has done here—try a few things on small fast models on small images on a small subset of the data to find out what data preprocessing and architecture to use, and then he would look at what are the constraints in operationalizing this (how much RAM do we have, how much latency can we get away with, how expensive is it going to be) to scale it up to the point where we are getting acceptable results using acceptable resources. It wouldn’t look very different at all than a Kaggle competition in terms of the modeling, but there would be a whole piece of it around user requirements, costs, and stuff like that.\nOne student tried going from smaller to larger models but it resulted in lower accuracy (note: this is what essentially happened to me, except for the large ensemble with 3-times weighted vit model which matches the small ensemble’s private score), is it just a fluke? No, it’s not a fluke. It means you pressed the wrong buttons somehow. Re-run Jeremy’s notebooks and then look at yours and see how they’re different. And then figure out where you went wrong. When debugging, look at the inputs and outputs—what predictions are you making? For example are you always predicting 0? Did you run lr.find to see what learning rate works well? Stuff like that.\nWhen exporting a model, the format is pickle but the file extension is pth (what PyTorch uses).\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the variety column in train.csv:\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\n\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_id\nlabel\nvariety\nage\n\n\n\n\n0\n100330.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n1\n100365.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n2\n100382.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n3\n100632.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n4\n101918.jpg\nbacterial_leaf_blight\nADT45\n45\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n10402\n107607.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10403\n107811.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10404\n108547.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10405\n110245.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n10406\n110381.jpg\ntungro\nZonal\n55\n\n\n\n\n10407 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.variety.value_counts()\n\nvariety\nADT45             6992\nKarnatakaPonni     988\nPonni              657\nAtchayaPonni       461\nZonal              399\nAndraPonni         377\nOnthanel           351\nIR20               114\nRR                  36\nSurya               32\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nAbout 70% of the ~10k rows of data are of the “ADT45” variety. But there are ~3k rows that contain other varieties. Something that is a bit counterintuitive: when there’s two different things (what kind of rice is it, what kind of disease is it) sometimes trying to get your model to predict two different things makes tham better at both. This sounds counterintuitive because you are giving it more work to do but you are also giving it more signal—things you’re teaching it to look for. So maybe if it knows how to recognize different kinds of rice, it can use that information to also recognize how different kinds of rice are impacted by different diseases. No idea if this is going to be useful or not but it would be an interesting exercise to try to do that. Also a good exercise of delving into models in a way we haven’t done before. This is going to be much more sophisticated than anything we’ve done with deep learning before. It’s a really good test of how well you understand what’s going on inside a neural network.\nJeremy trained a model three times to see what the error rate was, to see what kind of variation there is. A learning rate of 0.02 for 3 epochs gave consistent results. People are often into doing reproducible training where they have set the seed for their training and run the same thing everytime. I think that’s normally a bad idea because I actually want to see what the natural variation is and so if I make a change I want to know if the difference I see in the result is due to natural variation or it’s actually something significant. If the natural variation is very large, it’s going to be tough to see if you actually improved things. But then if the natural variation is so large that improvements are invisible then trying to improve it seems pointless because it sounds like you haven’t really found a way to stably train something. And normally that happens because the learning rate is too big. If you bump the learning rate to 0.04 you’ll see the error rate go all over the place (5%, 6^, etc.). Training for more epochs at a lower learning rate will generally give you more stable results. There’s a compromise because doing more epochs is slow. You could also try using a smaller subset of the data. In the end sometimes things will just be slow but most of the time Jeremy finds that you can get a compromise.\nWith 6 epochs at half the learning rate (0.01) the model is more accurate (4% error rate rather than 5%).\nThese improvements you make on a small scale show up on a larger scale. They pretty much always will because they are the same models with more layers or wider activations. If you find some preprocessing step that works well on a convnext tiny, it’s going to work also well on a convnext larg, 99.9% of the time. Most people act as if that’s not true, like in academia, or most people never think to try. But intuitively, of course it’s the same. Why wouldn’t it be the same? It’s the same model just scaled up a bit that behaves very similarly. You can argue that it’s intuitive, but it might not be intuitive because everybody has told you for years that it doesn’t work that way.\nI’ll run three trainings of the model as Jeremy has done, to get a sense of the variation in error rates for the convnext_tiny_in22k model:\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(\n    trn_path, seed=42, valid_pct=0.2,\n    item_tfms=Resize(480), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\n\narch = 'convnext_tiny_in22k'\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.183931\n0.734716\n0.228736\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.706453\n0.518948\n0.162422\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.408914\n0.192417\n0.058626\n01:03\n\n\n2\n0.220568\n0.127589\n0.037482\n01:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.156675\n0.834739\n0.226333\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.689531\n0.731114\n0.203268\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.420913\n0.229073\n0.076886\n01:05\n\n\n2\n0.221704\n0.140325\n0.041807\n01:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).to_fp16()\nlearn.fine_tune(3, 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.198419\n0.696659\n0.214320\n00:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.651208\n0.480119\n0.150889\n01:04\n\n\n1\n0.429291\n0.229344\n0.069197\n01:01\n\n\n2\n0.225388\n0.136109\n0.043248\n01:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final error rates for convnext_tiny_in22k using a learning rate of 0.02 for 3 epochs were 0.037482, 0.041807, and 0.043248 (the first time I ran these three models). The largest difference in error rate between the three models was 15%. That seems not great. In the video, Jeremy’s models had a difference of 3%.\nLet’s actually look at a model. To simplify things later on (when adding new layers to handle two categories of classification) we will remove the to_fp16 call.\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate)\n\n\nm = learn.model\n\nThere are two things at the top of the model:\n\nTimmBody (which has multiple things in it, the first being the model, which in turn has multiple things, the first being the stem, the next being stages and so on).\n\nThe body does all the hard work of looking at the pixels and trying to find features and things like that. In this case it’s a convolutional neural network. At the very end of it it spits out a whole bunch of information about those pixels.\n\nthe head ((1): Sequential).\n\nthe head makes sense of what the body spits out and returns predictions. The head is pretty simple, the body is not.\n\n\nWe want to predict two things: what kind of rice it is and what disease it has. Currently the very last layer is a linear layer:\n(8): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=10, bias=False)\nA lineary layer is something that does a matrix product, with an input of 512 features and output of 10 features.

We’re getting 512 inputs, and when we multiply them by this matrix we get 10 outputs.\nIf we removed this layer, the last layer would be taking in 1536 features and spitting out 512 features:\n(4): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=512, bias=False)\nWe’ll delete it, and then take those 512 features and create two linear layers for them, one with 10 outputs as before (for disease classification) and one with 10 outputs for variety classification (there are 10 varieties). The final output would be 2 x 10 for each image—one with probabilities for disease classes, and one for variety classes.\nLet’s do the easy thing first which is to delete the layer we don’t want. A PyTorch Sequential takes the output of each layer and passes it as the input to the next layer. If we delete the last layer, that’s no problem, it just won’t ever call it. PyTorch’s Sequential has normal list semantics so you can delete a layer like so:\n\ndel(h[-1])\n\n\nh\n\nSequential(\n  (0): AdaptiveConcatPool2d(\n    (ap): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=1)\n    (mp): AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size=1)\n  )\n  (1): fastai.layers.Flatten(full=False)\n  (2): BatchNorm1d(1536, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (3): Dropout(p=0.25, inplace=False)\n  (4): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=512, bias=False)\n  (5): ReLU(inplace=True)\n  (6): BatchNorm1d(512, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)\n  (7): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)\n)\n\n\nWe’re going to create a class which includes this model and adds the final two layers:\n\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\n\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(\n    trn_path, seed=42, valid_pct=0.2,\n    item_tfms=Resize(480), batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=224, min_scale=0.75))\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn2 = deepcopy(learn)\n\n\nclass DiseaseAndTypeClassifier(nn.Module):\n    # the constructor\n    def __init__(self, m):\n        super().__init__() # always call the superclass init to construct the object\n        self.l1 = nn.Linear(512, 10, bias=False) # variety\n        self.l2 = nn.Linear(512, 10, bias=False) # disease\n        del(m[1][-1]) # delete the last layer of the model's head\n        self.m = m # model\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.m(x)\n        x1 = self.l1(x) # variety output\n        x2 = self.l2(x) # disease output\n        return x1, x2\n\n\ndtc = DiseaseAndTypeClassifier(learn2.model)\nlearn2.model = dtc\n\nWhen calling get_preds even though with_loss=False the Learner is still needing to use the loss function for something. So, we’ll write the new loss function. The loss function is the thing which is a number which says how good is this model. The loss function that we were using was designed on something that only returned a single tensor. And now we’re returning a tuple of tensors (x1, x2). So that’s why when it tries to call the loss function, it gets confused.\nThe loss function is another thing that is stored inside the Learner.\n\nlearn.loss_func\n\nFlattenedLoss of CrossEntropyLoss()\n\n\nIn the initial new loss function, we’ll just return the loss for the disease predictions using the current loss function. We don’t have to split the targs yet because currently they hold just the disease targets. We’re going to have to change our data loading as well to include the rice variety as well.\nWhy is the loss function determined from the dataset? (As seen in the Learner source code).\nGenerally speaking, what is the appropriate loss function to use as a reasonable default depends on what kind of data you have. So if you’re data is a single continuous output you probably have a regression problem so you probably want mean squared error. If it’s a single categorical variable you probably want cross entropy loss. If you have a mult-categorical variable you probably want log loss without softmax. And so forth. By having it come from the dataset means that you can get sensible defaults that ought to work for that dataset. That’s why we generally don’t have to specify what loss function to use unless we’re doing something non-standard.\n\ncurr_loss = learn2.loss_func\n\n\ndef dtc_loss(preds, targs):\n    rice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n    return curr_loss(dis_preds, targs)\n\n\ndef dtc_error(preds, targs):\n    rice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n    return error_rate(dis_preds, targs)\n\n\nlearn2.loss_func = dtc_loss\nlearn2.metrics = [dtc_error]\n\n\nlearn2.loss_func\n\n&lt;function __main__.dtc_loss(preds, targs)&gt;\n\n\n\nlearn2.metrics\n\n(#1) [&lt;fastai.learner.AvgMetric object at 0x78339534eb00&gt;]\n\n\nAt this point we should be able to get some predictions to verify that the plumbing is working.\n\npreds, targs = learn2.get_preds(dl=learn2.dls.valid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve now got two sets of preditions, variety, and disease.\n\nlen(preds)\n\n2\n\n\n\npreds\n\n(tensor([[ 1.4707,  1.5254, -1.5469,  ...,  3.5859, -9.7422, -7.9531],\n         [ 2.8262, -0.3391, -1.0713,  ...,  3.9258, -6.7891, -5.5508],\n         [ 1.2178,  0.2090, -1.3574,  ...,  2.4629, -6.9688, -6.0234],\n         ...,\n         [ 1.2422,  0.5278, -0.7520,  ...,  1.9199, -7.2109, -6.4258],\n         [ 2.9219, -0.2183, -1.1211,  ...,  1.8584, -6.8516, -6.2461],\n         [ 2.0469,  0.6406, -1.3174,  ...,  3.8027, -9.2891, -5.8086]],\n        dtype=torch.float16),\n tensor([[ 2.8516, -2.9395, -3.2852,  ...,  1.3027, -1.5234, -2.8223],\n         [ 3.4375, -1.3428, -3.8047,  ..., -0.9033, -0.5435, -3.0449],\n         [ 4.1719, -1.0127, -2.9375,  ..., -0.5962,  0.7446, -3.3828],\n         ...,\n         [ 3.5781, -1.2656, -2.3008,  ..., -0.3660, -0.0957, -4.2734],\n         [ 4.9727, -0.4153, -2.6562,  ...,  0.9844,  0.7559, -3.6738],\n         [ 6.0703, -1.4375, -3.6797,  ..., -1.5928,  2.6211, -5.0625]],\n        dtype=torch.float16))\n\n\n\nrice_preds, dis_preds = preds\n\n\ndis_preds.shape\n\ntorch.Size([2081, 10])\n\n\nInitially, Jeremy got some errors when running learn2.get_preds(dl=learn2.dls.valid). To debug them, he first tried to get a minimum reproducible example—not changing learn.model to dtc. This still threw an error. Then, instead of running learn2 = copy(learn) he assigned to learn2 the line vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate).\nThat didn’t solve the problem either. Something was keeping some part of the Learner’s state in half-precision. Finally, Jeremy tried restarting the kernel. That solved the problem, and the get_preds call was successful.\nHe also got an error because the metrics function was trying to calculate on a tuple of preds, so in order to test just the new loss function at first, we removed the metrics from the Learner.\nWe should be able to replicate our disease clasification model at this point because we’re not doing anything with the extra rice type (variety).\n\nlearn2.model_dir = '/tmp/model'\n\n\nlearn2.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=0.0063095735386013985)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe valley (0.01) is pretty conservative so Jeremy recommends picking a learning rate further down the curve (0.1) which seems more reasonable. Look for a learning rate that’s as far to the right as possible but on a still pretty steep gradient.\n\nlearn2.fine_tune(1, 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\ndtc_error\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.070556\n1.182892\n0.401249\n00:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\ndtc_error\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.211720\n0.858449\n0.259491\n00:54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my next blog post I walk through the discussion and code from Live Coding 13, the last Live Coding video on the Paddy Doctor Kaggle competition."

    "text": "What Would I Do Differently?\nThere are quite a few things I would do differently:\n\nIterate faster. I tried my best to emulate Jeremy Howard’s approach in his Road to the Top series, but still spent a lot of time training early on since I was using the full dataset. For example, instead of taking 30-40 minutes to train each of the 50+ convnext_small_in22k models, if I used a subset of the data I could have trimmed that time down considerably.\nStart earlier. I joined the competition 2 months late, with 1 month to go. I would have spent one of those months trying out more variations (and subsets) of the data and another month experimenting with different architectures and augmentations.\nDon’t waste submissions. There are of course physical constraints (time, energy, resources) but I could have probably squeezed in 20 more submissions if I would have managed my time more efficiently. I lost a few days here and there waiting to see how my models performed in submissions instead of starting to train the next batch of experiments immediately while submitting the last batch. In some cases, I had to wait until all 10+ submissions each round completed to pick the top models to train next. On the other hand, I could have avoided wasting 3-4 days pursuing the wrong approach if I stopped for a day to collect my thoughts and reflect on my strategy more often.\nSubmit more models. My best-performing models didn’t always have best error rate during training, so there’s a chance that models I didn’t submit because they were the 6th or 7th or 12th-best based on training results might have performed well in submissions.\nSet aside a test set. Most of my models performed worse on the Private test set. I also couldn’t submit all the models I wanted because I was running out of days and submissions. If I had set aside a test set, I could have seen how more models performed on data not used during training or validation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post I’ll walk through some of the math involved in the research paper Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model.\nThe abstract:\n\nWhile large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.\n\nDPO involves preference data, a reference model and the parameterized model (i.e. the model being trained).\nI found this section of the paper provide the most intuition about why DPO works:\n\nAs the model gets more likely to pick the preferred response, the gradient increases. Conversely, as the implicit reward (log probability ratio of parameterized model and reference model) for rejected responses increases, the gradient increases. I think of these two terms contrasting each other, keeping the gradient from vanishing or exploding.\nIn the next few sections of this blog post, I’ll walk through parts of the paper where I found that math either challenging (and used Claude or ChatGPT to help me figure it out) and/or particulary helpful for my understanding of the concepts. In the final section, I do my best to connect the code implementation of DPO loss with the math formulas provided in the paper. Overall I found this process very rewarding and built my confidence to take on understanding the mathy parts of the paper moving forward."

    "text": "Section 3: Preliminaries\n\nReward Modelling Phase\nBradley-Terry model stipulates that the human preference distribution \\(p^*\\) can be written as:\nEquation (1): \\[ p^*(y_1 \\succ y_2|x) = \\frac{\\exp(r^*(x, y_1))}{\\exp(r^*(x, y_1)) + \\exp(r^*(x, y_2))}\\]\nWhere \\(r^*(y, x)\\) is a latent reward model we don’t have access to.\n(I don’t know if it’s mathematically correct to say this but \\(p^*\\) function looks like softmax).\n\\(\\succ\\) = “succeeds” symbol. A couple of definitions I found online, seems pretty straightforward:\n\nThe term successor and predecessor in Math means that they come directly after or before the particular number respectively. Both successor and predecessor basically applied only to the whole numbers. The successor is termed as after numbers whereas the predecessor is termed as before numbers.\nSuccessor in Math refers to the after the term of a particular term while the predecessor in Math refers to them before the term of a particular term. We can find the successor of a whole number by adding one to the particularly given number whereas to find the predecessor of a whole number we will subtract one from the particularly given number. In this article, we will study what are successor and predecessor, successor meaning, predecessor meaning, how to find the successor of a given number, how to find the predecessor of a given number, etc. Source.\n\n\n\nThe succeeds operator (≻) is a generalization of idea behind some numbers being bigger than others.\nThe succeeds operator (≻) is like 10>4 , except that it applies to objects other than numbers. (Source)\n\n\n\nA preference relation expresses the consumer’s feelings between pairs of objects in X . We denote the preference relation by \\(\\succeq\\) and imagine that for every pair x and y from X , the consumer is willing to say that either x \\(\\succeq\\) y , meaning x is at least as good as y, or not. Source\n\nStatic dataset of comparisons sampled from \\(p^*\\):\n\\[\\mathcal{D}\\{x^{(i)}, y_w^{(i)}, y_l^{(i)}\\}^N\\]\nAssuming we have access to \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) we can parameterize a reward model \\(r_{\\phi}(x,y)\\) and estimate parameters via maximum likelihood. Framed as a binary classification problem we have the negative log-likelihood loss:\nEquation (2):\n\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_R(r_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{D}) = -\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l)\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\log\\sigma(r_{\\phi}(x, y_w) -  r_{\\phi}(x, y_l)\\big]\\]\n\nIn the loss function above, as \\(r_{\\phi}(x, y_w) - r_{\\phi}(x, y_l)\\) increases (the model assigns higher reward to the preferred response), sigmoid (\\(\\sigma\\), blue function below) goes to 1 and \\(-\\log\\sigma\\) (red function below) goes to 0.\n\nThe network \\(r_{\\phi}\\) is often initialized from the SFT model \\(\\pi^{SFT}(y|x)\\) with the addition of a linear layer on top of the final transformer layer that produces a single scalar prediction for the reward value.\n\n\nRL Fine-Tuning Phase\nOptimization problem formulated as:\nEquation (3):\n\\[\\max_{\\pi_{\\theta}}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}, y\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(y|x)}[r_\\phi(x,y)]-\\beta\\mathbb{D}_{KL}[\\pi_\\theta(y|x) \\;||\\; \\pi_{ref}(y|x)]\\]\n\\(\\beta\\) is a parameter controlling the deviation from the base reference policy \\(\\pi_{ref}\\) (the initial SFT model \\(\\pi^{SFT}\\)).\nThe language model policy \\(\\pi_\\theta\\) is also initialized to \\(\\pi^{SFT}\\).\nThis objective is not differentiable because language generation is discrete, so the standard approach is to construct the reward function as:\n\\[ r(x,y) = r_\\phi(x,y)-\\beta(\\log\\pi_\\theta(y|x) - \\log\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\]\nAnd maximize it using PPO."

The second term is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the conditional distribution \\(\\pi(y|x)\\) and a reference conditional distribution \\(\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\).\nNow, to transform it into Step 2:\n\\[\\max_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim\\pi(y|x)}\\big[r(x,y)]-\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)}\\big]\\]\nWe will separate the expectation over \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and then express the KL divergence term differently.\n\nSeparation of expectations: We start by separating the joint expectation into two nested expectations:\n\n\\[\\max_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\left[ \\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim\\pi(y|x)}\\left[r(x,y)\\right]\\right] - \\beta\\mathbb{D}_{KL}[\\pi(y|x) \\;||\\; \\pi_{ref}(y|x)]\\]\n\nTransforming the KL divergence term:\n\nNext, we express the KL divergence term differently using its definition:\n\\[\\mathbb{D}_{KL}[\\pi(y|x) \\;||\\; \\pi_{ref}(y|x)] = \\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim\\pi(y|x)}\\left[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)}\\right]\\]\nHere, we are effectively taking the expectation over \\(y\\) for the logarithm of the ratio of the two distributions.\nAfter these transformations, we have successfully rewritten Step 1 into the desired form of Step 2.

Let’s break down the steps:\n\nNegate the Objective Function:\n\nTo transform a maximization problem into a minimization problem, we can simply negate the objective function. Since maximizing \\(\\mathbb{E}[f(x)]\\) is equivalent to minimizing \\(−\\mathbb{E}[f(x)]\\), we negate the entire objective function:\n\\[-\\big(r(x,y)-\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)}\\big) = \\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)} - r(x,y) \\]\n\nReorder the terms\n\nNext, we rearrange the terms in the objective function to match the desired form.\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)} - \\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\]\nBy dividing the second term by \\(\\beta\\), we transform the maximization problem into a minimization problem with a positive weight on the reward term.\n\nI think what is implied in the above explanation is that you are allowed to divide the optimization objective by a constant (in this case, \\(\\beta\\)).\n\nNext in the paper is Step 4:\n\\[\\min_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim\\pi(y|x)}\\big[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\frac{1}{Z(x)}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))} - \\log Z(x)\\big]\\]\nWhere:\n\\[Z(x) = \\sum_{y}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\]\nis the “partition function”.\nChatGPT didn’t have a very helpful explanation (even after multiple prompts) except for the following explanation of why \\(Z(x)\\) is needed:\n\nWe introduce a normalization constant \\(Z(x)\\) inside the logarithm. This constant ensures that the expression inside the logarithm integrates to 1, effectively making it a probability distribution.\n\nI’ll try to connect the dots myself.\nThis:\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)} - \\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\]\n\nShould be shown to be equal to this:\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\frac{1}{Z(x)}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))} - \\log Z(x)\\]\nI’ll start with the “normalized” version:\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\frac{1}{Z(x)}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))} - \\log Z(x)\\]\n\nrewrite the denominator:\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\frac{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))}{Z(x)}} - \\log Z(x)\\]\n\nApply the property of logarithm \\(\\log(\\frac{a}{b}) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)\\) to the first term:\n\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\log\\frac{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))}{Z(x)} - \\log Z(x)\\]\n\nApply that property to the second term (putting it inside brackets to maintain the minus sign before it):\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\big[\\log\\big( \\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\big) - \\log Z(x) \\big] - \\log Z(x)\\]\n\nMinus a negative becomes a plus:\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\log \\big(\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\big) + \\log Z(x) - \\log Z(x)\\]\n\nThe \\(\\log Z(x)\\)’s cancel out:\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\log \\big(\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\big)\\]\n\nApplying the property of logarithms \\(\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)\\):\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\big[\\log \\pi_{ref}(y|x) + \\log\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\big]\\]\n\nMinus a positive stays a minus:\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\log \\pi_{ref}(y|x) - \\log\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\log(\\exp(x)) = x\\):\n\\[\\log\\pi(y|x) - \\log \\pi_{ref}(y|x) - \\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\]\n\nApplying the property that \\(\\log(a) - \\log(b) = \\log(\\frac{a}{b})\\):\n\\[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)} - \\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y) \\]\nWhich is the original expression.\nNext in the paper they define a “valid probability distribution” as:\n\\[\\pi^*(y|x) = \\frac{1}{Z(x)}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\big)\\]\n\nThey say it’s valid because \\(\\pi^*(y|x) \\ge 0\\) for all \\(y\\) and \\(\\sum_{y}\\pi^*(y|x) = 1\\). They don’t provide much detail. I’ll rewrite that expression with the full form of \\(Z(x)\\):\n\\[\\pi^*(y|x) = \\frac{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\big)}{Z(x)}\\]\n\n\\[\\pi^*(y|x) = \\frac{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\big)}{\\sum_{y}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))}\\]\n\nThat looks like the softmax function, which is a valid probability distribution so I’m going with that understanding for now.\nNext in the paper they rewrite the optimization objective with this \\(\\pi^*\\) expression:\n\\[\\min_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\mathbb{E}_{y\\sim\\pi(y|x)} \\big[\\log\\frac{\\pi(y|x)}{\\pi^*(y|x)}\\big] -\\log Z(x) \\big]\\]\n\nthe first term inside the first set of brackets is KL-divergence:\n\\[\\min_{\\pi}\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\mathbb{D}_{KL} \\big(\\pi(y|x) \\; || \\; \\pi^*(y|x)\\big) -\\log Z(x) \\big]\\]\n\n\\(Z(x)\\) does not depend on \\(y\\) so minimizing the objective is dependent only on minimizing the KL-divergence term, which is minimized to 0 when the two probability distributions are identical:\n\\[\\pi(y|x) = \\pi^*(y|x) = \\frac{1}{Z(x)}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\big)\\]\n\nI’ll rewrite that with the full form of \\(Z(x)\\):\n\\[\\pi(y|x) = \\pi^*(y|x) = \\frac{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp\\big(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y)\\big)}{\\sum_{y}\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\exp(\\frac{1}{\\beta}r(x,y))}\\]"

Their RLHF model refused to answer controversial questions or got stuck in evasive responses. Evasiveness was rewarded by their crowdworkers. Models should always engage and explain (examples of which we’ll see later on).\n\n\nSimplicity and Transparency\n\nRLHS uses tens of thousands of human feedback labels which can’t be summarized effectively.\nHow to reduce iteration time?\n\nReplace human feedback for harmlessness with AI feedback.\nEncode harmlessness training goals in natural language.\n\nHow to improve transparency?\n\nCoT makes AI decision-making explicit.\nTrain AI assistants to explain why they are declining to engage with harmful requests (i.e. always engage and explain).\n\n\n\n\nAI Feedback\nIn 2021, Anthropic did research showing that models could achieve 90% accuracy in predicting the more helpful, honest and harmless of two responses in a conversation between human and AI (across 221 binary comparisons).\n\nIn the figures above, pretrained off-the-shelf language models above 50B parameters perform close to RLHF trained models in classifying harmful behavior.\nThey took this a step futher in this paper, by adding 217 more challenging comparisons (subtle tests of harmlessness with evasiveness disfavored) to the existing 221. They then evaluated a preference model trained on several 100k of human preference labels and an off-the-shelf pretrained LM on the 438 comparisons and found that the pretrained LM, at ~50B parameters, especially with CoT prompting, was close to the performance of the preference model (figure below)."

RL-CAI (CoT) is more harmless than all other models.\n\nOver the course of RL training, the helpfulness of all models increases. The harmlessness of RL-CAI (CoT) increases while the other three models’ harmlessness decreases after about a third of the training. Note that the initial snapshot of RL-CAI is SL-CAI.\n\nWe see a Pareto improvement for Constitutional RL, meaning that its harmlessness increases without penalizing its helpfulness.\n\n\n\nGoodharting Behavior\nOvertraining the model results in overly harsh responses to harmful prompts or the model includes boilerplate language from the training set into its response.\n\n\nQualitative Diversity\n\nThe authors rewrote the constitutional principles to discourage overreactive/accusatory responses which was qualitatively successful:\n\n\nCompare the degree of harmfulness in the assistant responses and choose the one that’s less harmful. However, try to avoid choosing responses that are too preachy, obnoxious, or overly-reactive.\n\n\nEnsembling over 16 principles led to more robust preference model scores.\nNormalized log-probabilities (for non-CoT) and clamping (for CoT) led to better results than hard labels (0s and 1s).\n\n\n\nHarmlessness vs. Evasiveness\n\nNon-evasive responses are more compatiable with helpfulness.\nRL-CAI is virtually never evasive.\n\n\n\nAbsolute Harmlessness Score\nInstead of relative harmless based on preference labels across models, the authors studied absolute harmlessness with a single model.\n\nCrowdworkers had conversations with a single model intentionally eliciting harmful or toxic responses through prompting (red teaming).\nThey rated “success” in getting the model to respond with something harmful from 0 to 4.\nAuthors finetuned a language model to score harmfulness of the crowdworkers’ full conversations as an additional metric.\nThe “success” metric isnot well-calibrated as different workers are biased in their own ways.\n\nThe results showed that as the models were being trained with RL, the absolute harmfulness score for all models except the helpful RLHF decreased."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nI thoroughly enjoyed reading, preparing, presenting and writing about this research paper. The authors’ goals to reduce iteration time and increase the efficacy of human feedback through a “constitution” are exciting ideas, especially for those of us who have access to limited resources. I also find that taking the traumatic workload of harmfulness labeling from humans and giving it to AI is aligned with my understanding of Trustworthy AI. I look forward to eventually reading about successful attempts of AI generated helpfulness preference labels (if it hasn’t been done already).\nI hope you enjoyed this paper summary!"

    "text": "In this blog post I’ll summarize the research paper RewardBench: Evaluating Reward Models for Language Modeling. Here’s the abstract:\n\nReward models (RMs) are at the crux of successful RLHF to align pretrained models to human preferences, yet there has been relatively little study that focuses on evaluation of those reward models. Evaluating reward models presents an opportunity to understand the opaque technologies used for alignment of language models and which values are embedded in them. To date, very few descriptors of capabilities, training methods, or open-source reward models exist. In this paper, we present RewardBench, a benchmark dataset and code-base for evaluation, to enhance scientific understanding of reward models. The RewardBench dataset is a collection of prompt-win-lose trios spanning chat, reasoning, and safety, to benchmark how reward models perform on challenging, structured and out-of-distribution queries. We created specific comparison datasets for RMs that have subtle, but verifiable reasons (e.g. bugs, incorrect facts) why one answer should be preferred to another. On the RewardBench leaderboard, we evaluate reward models trained with a variety of methods, such as the direct MLE training of classifiers and the implicit reward modeling of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and on a spectrum of datasets. We present many findings on propensity for refusals, reasoning limitations, and instruction following shortcomings of various reward models towards a better understanding of the RLHF process."

    "text": "Datasets\nThe authors define the following subsets on which they evaluate reward model performance:\n\nChat\nChat Hard\nSafety\nReasoning\nPrior Sets\n\nThe first four subsets are curated (some are modified) from existing benchmark evaluation sets. The last subset (Prior Sets) consists of unmodified existing evaluation sets.\n\nChat\nThe Chat subset includes prompts curated from two benchmarks:\n\nAlpacaEval\n\nEasy: 100 prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\nLength: 95 prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\nHard: 95 manually verified prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\n\nMT Bench\n\nEasy: 28 manually verified prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\nMedium: 40 manually verified prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\n\n\nThe AlpacaEval Length subset is designed to differentiate between other Chat subsets by having notably different model capabilities with the same average length.\n\nAlpacaEval\n\nAlpacaEval is an automated tool for evaluation instruction-folliwng language models against the AlpacaFarm dataset.\nAlpacaEval 2.0 with length-controlled win-rates has a spearman correlation of 0.98 with ChatBot Arena.\nChatBot Arena is a crowdsourced open platform for LLM evals with 700,000+ human pairwise comparisons to rank LLMs.\n\n“length-controlled” is a way to account for the bias that LLMs have towards longer responses (i.e. they prefer responses that are longer).\nHere is an example prompt-chosen-rejected tri from the alpacaeval-easy dataset. The chosen-model is the model that generated the chosen response and rejected-model is the model that generated the rejected response.\n\nHere a trio from the alpacaeval-length dataset, where the prompt lengths for chosen and rejected responses are similar.\n\nHere’s a trio from alpacaeval-length with different prompt lengths for the chosen and rejected response showing that there is variation in prompt lengths even though the average length across the full dataset between chosen and rejected responses is similar.\n\n\n\nMT Bench\n\nMT Bench is designed to test multi-turn conversation (AlpacaEval was single-turn only) and instruction-following ability across 8 categories of user prompts: writing, roleplay, extraction, reasining, math, coding, knowledge I (STEM), and knowledge II (humanities/social science).\n\nHere’s a trio from the mt-bench-easy dataset where claude-v1 correctly counts the specific words while raven-14b deviates from the instruction.\n\n\n\n\nChat Hard\n\nMT Bench\n\nHard: 37 manually verified prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\n\nLLMBar\n\nNatural: 100 manually verified prompt-chosen-rejected trios.\nAdversarial\n\nNeighbor: 134 trios.\nGPT4Inst: 92 trios.\nGPTOut: 47 trios.\nManual: 46 trios.\n\n\n\n\nLLMBar\nThe LLMBar dataset contains responses to prompts that are preferred and dispreferred.\n\nNatural\n\nInstances from existing subject human-preference datasets, filtered/modified for objective preference.\n\nAdversarial\n\nDispreffered output deviates from the instruction but often has good superficial qualities and may thus distract the evaluator.\n\n\nHere’s a trio where the rejected response deviates from the instruction but is coherent, uses good grammar, and has a conclusive response. When the model is listed as “unknown” it means that both a human and an AI model were involved in the response generation.\n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nRefusals\n\nDangerous: 100 trios.\nOffensive: 100 trios.\n\nDo Not Answer\n\n136 trios.\n\nXSTest\n\nShould Respond\n\n250 manually selected trios.\n\nShould Refuse\n\n154 manually selected trios.\n\n\n\n\nRefusals\nAn in-development refusals dataset at AI2, where the chosen response is a refusal and the rejected is harmful text is of either dangerous or offensive nature.\nThe following refusals-dangerous trio involves a medical scenario where the model should refuse to respond.\n\nIn the following trio, the rejected model is tricked by the user prompt that the heist is for a novel and it provides a helpful but dangerous response.\n\n\n\nDo Not Answer\n\nA dataset curated and filtered to consist of only instructions responsible language models should now follow.\n\n\nThe following trio from the donotanswer dataset shows how the model should refuse to respond to the prompt.\n\n\n\nXSTest\nThe prompts from this XSTest subset were designed to test for exaggerated safety behavior by containing certain, seemingly unsafe, trigger words while actually being safe to comply to.\nIn the following trio from the xstest-should-respond dataset, the model tricks the rejected model into thinking the prompt is offensive by using the phrase “not be allowed to lead public companies”.\n\n\n\n\nReasoning\n\nHumanEvalPack (164 prompts each)\n\nCPP\nGo\nJavaScript\nJava\nRust\nPython\n\nPRM (Process Reward Model) Math\n\nFiltered/select answers from the PRM800k dataset.\n\n\n\nHumanEvalPack\n\nHumanEvalPack expands the HumanEval benchmark to 3 coding tasks (Code Repair, Code Explanation, Code Synthesis) across 6 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust)\nHandwritten HumanEval measures functional correctness for synthesizing python programs from docstrings.\n\nHere’s a trio from the hep-python dataset:\n\n\n\nPRM Math\n\nPRM800k is an 800k step-level labels over 75000 solutions.\n\n\nA trio from the math-prm dataset where the chosen response is human-generated.\n\n\n\n\nPrior Sets\n\nAnthropic\n\nHelpful\nHarmless*\nHHH\n\nMT Bench\n\nGPT-4*\nHuman*\n\nStanford Human Preferences (SHP)\nOpenAI’s Learning to Summarize\n\n* Not used in the RewardBench leaderboard.\nHere’s a trio from the Anthropic Helpful dataset where the chosen model provides a helpful response to the prompt and rejecte response is not helpful.\n\nA trio from Anthropic HHH where the chosen model provides an honest response “I’m not sure…if I had to guess…” while the rejected model provides a confident incorrect response.\n\nA trio from the Helpful subset of Anthropic HHH where the chosen model gives pros for each vacation destination whereas the rejected model gives a non-committal response.\n\nA trio from SHP where the chosen response is more detailed and thorough than the reject response (in my opinion).

In my opinion, both responses are similar.\n\n\nHere is a summary of the datasets used for the RewardBench leaderboard, including a description of how chosen-rejected responses are generated.\n\n\n\nDistribution of Source Completions\nThe chosen and rejected responses are generated by a variety of models (including humans and both humans and models—“unknown”). Humans are the most common source of the response, with “unknown”, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 and Llama-2-70b-chat rounding out the top five overall and for chosen responses. Two Mistral-7B variants are 4th and 5th most used for rejected responses."

    "text": "Results\n\nLeaderboard (from the paper)\nThe following table shows the top-20 models in terms of average performance (accuracy) on the five subsets of Chat, Chat Hard, Safety, Reasoning and Prior Sets. Note that 15 of the top 20 are DPO models, with 5 Sequence Classifiers. A random model would have an accuracty of 50% when chosing the preferred response. The highlighted accuracies are the highest in each column.\n\n\n\nLeaderboard as of 4/26/2024\nThe current leaderboard (at the time I made this presentation) had many new models involved. A Starling variant was still in the top 5, while Allen AI’s tulu-2-dpo-70B had dropped to 11th place.\n\nWhen sorting by Prior Sets (descending) you can see the paper’s findings in action—none of the top 20 models were trained by DPO.\n\n\n\nScaling Trends\nThe authors found that DPO trained models followed scaling laws (accuracy generally increased with model size). Whereas in the Qwen1.5 family (not DPO trained) for example, the accuracy actually regresses on Prior Sets as model size increases.\n\n\n\n7B Models\nThe Zephyr-7B variants performed well in Chat Hard and Reasoning.\n\n\n\nChat Hard\nOn Chat Hard some models performed worse than random.\n\n\n\nSafety\nThe authors highlighted three model behaviors for safety:\n\nTop section: models refuse or respond when they should.\nMiddle: Models always refuse (low accuracy on Should Respond).\nBottom: Models always respond (low accuracy on Should Refuse).\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Model Accuracy by Dataset\nThe highlighted distributions show how for some datasets, none of the models had an accuracy anywhere close to 100%, showing an opportunity to improve these datasets and modeling methods.\n\n\n\nPrompt Length Distribution by Dataset\nThe authors showed the variation in (and average of) prompt lengths across the various datasets. Note that the AlpacaEval Length prompt lengths vary a lot although the average prompt length of chosen and rejected responses are close. For most of the other datasets the averages are either close (HumanEvalPack) or the chosen responses had a shorter prompt (LLMBar).\n\n\n\nDPO vs Classifier RMs\n\nThis is an understudied field.\nDPO model availability due to low compute requirements.\nDPOs perform well on all subsets except Prior Sets.\nLack of documentation on reference models restricts DPO evaluation because using the “wrong” reference model leads to lower DPO performance.\nDPOs regularize with KL.\nDPOs are trained for multiple epochs (Sequence Classifiers usually trained for 1 epoch)."

    "text": "Prompt and Response Examples\nI’ve highlighted a few examples from the paper that show how the phi models behave. First, a comparison between phi-1, phi-1-base and phi-1-small responses to the same prompt asking them to code a problem involving multiple mathematical relationships. phi-1 successfully provides the right answer. phi-1-base (pretrained only) returns relevant code names and values but with absolutely no structure for the operations involved. phi-1-small gets about 80% of the solution right, with a couple of errors within the correct structure of the solution.\n\nIn the response below, phi-1.5 is able to take into consideration unconventional information (raining in the middle of July) and incorporate it into its story-telling response.\n\nIn the example below, phi-1.5 corretly generates a respone that aligns with the prompt but then continue on to generate unwanted text in the format of Exercise/Answer. I wonder if it’s following its textbook-like training data’s format.\n\nLastly, I tried phi-1.5’s code to check latency and found one error in its syntax (the use of decode instead of encode). Otherwise, the syntax matched the documentation example of Python’s subprocess module."

    "text": "Sequence Modeling Review\nBefore getting into the details of the Transformer architecture introduced in this paper, I’ll do a short overview of the main type of architecture (RNN) that the Transformer is improving upon. Most importantly, the Transformer is improves upon the dependencies between tokens in long sequences.\n\nRecurrent Neural Nets (RNNs)\nIn Max’s post he provides the following illustration of RNNs, where the inputs are recursively passed through the hidden laye and at each iteration, the hidden layer state from the previous step is incorporated in the current state’s calculation. In this way, RNNs store information about the previous step in the next step.\nThe forward pass in Max’s post is given as:\ndef forward(self, X, i=0, h=0):\n  l1 = lin(X[i], self.w1)\n  h = relu(l1 + h*self.w2)\n  if (i+1 != len(X)):\n    return self.foward(X, i+1, h)\nThe hidden state from the previous iteration h is multiplied by a trainable weight w2, added to the output of the linear function lin(X[i], self.w1) and passed through a non-linearity (in this case a ReLU) to get the current state h. Until the end of the input sequence is reached, the forward pass continues to recursively incorporate previous state information into the current input’s calculation.\n\n\nThe study of RNNs highlights how, in the basic RNN architecture, as the time instants considered increase, the product chain determined by backpropagation through time tends to zero or tends to extremely large values. In the first case, we have a vanishing gradient, in the second case an exploding gradient. (source).\n\n\n\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nTo combat this training instability for long sequences, the LSTM network is used. This is an RNN architecutre capable of learning long-term dependencies with long-term memory (cell state C in the diagram) and short-term memory (hidden state H in the diagram).\n\n(source).\nThe LSTM uses past information (H) and new information (X) to update long-term memory (C). It then uses C to update H, and the cycle continues for the next input sequence.\nIn the diagram below, at the bottom left, the Hidden state from the previous step, \\(\\textbf{H}_{t-1}\\) is combined with the new Input of the current step \\(\\textbf{X}_t\\) and goes into the different gates for different purposes (Forget gate, Input gate, Candidate memory, and Output gate).\nThe \\(+\\) operator is the combining of long-term memory from the previous step \\(\\textbf{C}_{t-1}\\) with the output of the Candidate memory \\(\\tilde{C_t}\\).\nFinally, the Output gate \\(\\textbf{O}_t\\) combines the long-term memory \\(\\textbf{C}_t\\) with the sigmoid output of \\(\\textbf{H}_{t-1}\\) and \\(\\textbf{X}_t\\) to create the hidden state for the current step \\(\\textbf{H}_t\\).\nThe hidden state and long-term memory are then used in the next input step."

    "text": "Transformer Architecture Overview\n\nDoes not use recurrence.\nRelies entirely on the attention mechanism for global dependencies.\nAllows for parallelization (as opposed to sequential processing).\n\n\nThe Transformer achieves better BLUE scores than previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the English-to-German and English-to-French machine translation tests at a fraction of the training cost.\n\n\nHere are the current English-to-German SOTA results:\n\nsource\nAnd the current English-to-French SOTA results:\n\nsource\nHere is the paper’s beautiful diagram (with my annotations) of an Encoder-Decoder Transformer architecture:\n\nThe inputs (numericalized tokens) pass through the Input Embedding which projects these numbers into a much larger number of dimensions, dimensions in which different information about the tokens will be learned through training. In this paper they use a dimension of 512 (referred to as the “hidden dimension”). This value is a hyperparameter and different architectures use different numbers of hidden dimensions.\nThe output of this Embedding is passed through a Positional Encoding step which quantitatively stores information about the position of each token. Since Transformers don’t explicitly express position as sequence modeling does, we have to implicitly express position in this way.\nThe inputs, after going through the Embedding and Positional Encoding, now enter the Encoder which is a type of Transformer Block containing Mult-Head Attention, Add & Norm layers and a Feed Forward Network.\nThe outputs follow a similar path, first through an Output Embedding, then Positional Encoding, and then a Decoder which is another type of Transform Block. A Transformer can be Encoder-only, Decoder-only or Encoder-Decoder. In this paper they focus on Encoder-Decoder Transformers, where information learned in the Encoder is used in the Decoder in a process call cross-attention that we’ll look into shortly. In this paper, they have 6 Encoder blocks and 6 Decoder blocks. The number of blocks can be varied (i.e. it’s a hyperparameter).\nThe outputs of the Decoder pass through a final linear layer and then a softmax layer (transformed into 0 to 1.0 probabilities).\n\nThe encoder receives the input text that is to be translated, and the decoder generates the translated text. (source)\n\n\nFundamentally, both encoder- and decoder-style architectures use the same self-attention layers to enocde word tokens. However, the main difference is that encoders are designed to learn embeddings that can be used for various predictive modeling tasks such as classification. In contrast, decoders are designed to generate new texts, for example, answering user queries. (source)\n\n\nThe encoder part in the original transformer…is responsible for understanding and extracting the relevant information from the input text. It then outputs a continuous representation (embedding) of the input text that is passed to the decoder. Finally, the decoder generates the translated text (target language) based on the continuous representation received from the encoder. (source)\n\nFrom Benjamin Warner’s post:\n\nIf we use the first sentence in this post and assume each word is a token:\nTransformers are everywhere.\nthen the “Transformers” token would predict “are”, and “are” would predict “everywhere.”\nTo create our inputs (line 1) we’ll drop the last token and to create the labels (line 2) we’ll remove the first token:\n\nTransformers are\nare everywhere"

Before we do that, I’ll save the current state of the inputs in a variable so that later on I can add it to the output of the attention mechanism.\n\nresidual_x = x\n\nThe particular flavor of attention used at this point is Scaled Dot-Product Attention across multiple heads. Here’s the steps taken in Scaled Dot-Product Attention:\n\nWhere \\(Q\\) (query), \\(K\\) (key) and \\(V\\) (value) are matrices (initially of random numbers) that consist of learned weights during training.\nThe first step is the matrix multiplication of \\(Q\\) and \\(K^T\\), followed by scaling that result by the square root of the dimension \\(d_k\\). The encoder doesn’t have a mask (the decoder does). Finally, the softmax is taken of that scaled dot product and its output matrix multiplied with \\(V\\).\nHere’s a conceptual understanding of attention from the Illustrated GPT-2:\n\nAnd here’s a visualization of attention values between tokens:\n\nBefore we get into the code for attention, here is a visualization of Mult-Head Attention, where the Scaled Dot-Product Attention occurs simultaneously across multiple heads, displaying the parallelization capability of Transformers:\n\nWe’ll go bottom-up in the diagram:\n\nCreate Q, K, V matrices. Split them across \\(h\\) heads.\nPerform Scaled Dot-Product Attention.\nConcatenate them from \\(h\\) heads.\nPass them through a final Linear layer.\n\nBoth Benjamin and CodeEmporium created a single Linear layer and then split them into \\(Q\\), \\(K\\) and \\(V\\), so I’ll do the same. A reminder (to myself and the reader) that these are weight matrices that will be used eventually to multiply by the inputs.\n\nqkv_layer = nn.Linear(d_model, 3 * d_model)\nqkv_layer\n\nLinear(in_features=512, out_features=1536, bias=True)\n\n\nPassing the inputs through this linear layer gives us the matrices:\n\nqkv = qkv_layer(x)\nqkv.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 200, 1536])\n\n\nNext, we project the \\(Q\\), \\(K\\) and \\(V\\) combined matrix across 8 heads\n\nnum_heads = 8\nhead_dim = d_model // num_heads\n\nqkv = qkv.reshape(batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_heads, 3 * head_dim)\nqkv.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 200, 8, 192])\n\n\nThis splits the 1536 values into 8 sets of 192.\nIn CodeEmporium’s code, they swap the middle two dimensions so it’s broadcastable with tensors later on\n\nqkv = qkv.permute(0, 2, 1, 3)\nqkv.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 8, 200, 192])\n\n\nWe then split qkv into three separate matrices, each with 200 x 64 values on each of the 8 heads:\n\nq, k, v = qkv.chunk(3, dim=-1)\nq.shape, k.shape, v.shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64]),\n torch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64]),\n torch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64]))\n\n\nFinally, we can create the attention matrix. First we perform the scaled dot-product between \\(Q\\) and \\(K\\)\n\nd_k = torch.tensor(q.shape[-1]) # 64\n\nscaled_dot_product = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-1, -2)) / torch.sqrt(d_k)\nscaled_dot_product.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 8, 200, 200])\n\n\nNote that when \\(K\\) is transposed, the last two dimensions are swapped to allow for correct matrix multiplication dimension order.\n\nq.shape, k.shape, k.transpose(-1, -2).shape\n\n(torch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64]),\n torch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64]),\n torch.Size([64, 8, 64, 200]))\n\n\nThe dimension of 64 matches between \\(Q\\) and \\(K^T\\) after .transpose(-1 ,-2) swaps the last two dimensions of \\(K\\).\nOne thing I noticed in both Benjamin and CodeEmporium’s code is that they define attention as the output of passing the scaled dot-product through softmax. This is the “attention matrix” I’ve seen referred to in places. The paper defines attention as the product of the matrix multiplication between that softmax output and the \\(V\\) (values) matrix.\n\n\nattention = F.softmax(scaled_dot_product, dim=-1)\n\n\nattention.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 8, 200, 200])\n\n\ndim is set to -1 so that the values in the last dimension are between 0 and 1.\n\nattention[0,0,0].shape, attention[0,0,0].sum()\n\n(torch.Size([200]), tensor(1., grad_fn=<SumBackward0>))\n\n\nattention’s final dimensions are of size 200 x 200, representing weights corresponding to the relationship between each of the 200 tokens.\n\nv = torch.matmul(attention, v)\nv.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64])\n\n\nFrom Benjamin’s post:\n\nNext we matrix multiply the Attention weights with our value matrix \\(V\\) which applies the Attention weights to our propagating token embeddings\n\n\nx.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 200, 512])\n\n\n\nx = attention @ v\nx.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 8, 200, 64])\n\n\nNext, we have to concatenate across the 8 heads:\n\nx = x.reshape(batch_size, max_sequence_length, num_heads * head_dim)\nx.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 200, 512])\n\n\nNow the 64 dimensions across 8 heads are concatenated to get back to the embedding size of 512. We still maintain the 64 batches and 200 sequence length.\nThe last step before the attention mechanism is fully complete is to pass these values through a linear layer:\n\nlinear_layer = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\nx = linear_layer(x)\nx.shape\n\ntorch.Size([64, 200, 512])\n\n\nThe linear layer maintains the dimension (512 in, 512 out).\nx then passes through a Dropout layer and a Layer Normalization layer. Note that residual_x is added to x before the sum is passed through the Layer Normalization.\nI won’t walk through the details of Layer Normalization, but CodeEmporium provides the following code that I’ll highlight the following few lines from:\nmean = x.mean(dim=[-1], keepdim=True)\nvar = ((x - mean) ** 2).mean(dim=[-1], keepdim=True)\nstd = (var + 1e-5).sqrt()\n\ny = (x - mean) / std\nx = gamma * y + beta\nWhere gamma and beta are learnable nn.Parameter weights. Note that the values are normalized (resulting in y) and then normalization occurs across all samples (gamma * y + beta).\nx is stored as residual_x to add on later, and then x goes through a Feed Forward Network (a non-linearity, in this case a GELU, and a Dropout layer sandwiched between two linear layers), and then through another Dropout layer and Layer Normalization (where residual_x is added to x)."

    "text": "Code Overview: Decoder\nThere are some similarities and some differences between the Encoder and the Decoder. Note that in CodeEmporium’s implementation, the Decoder contains Self Attention and Encoder-Decoder Attention (also called Cross Attention in Benjamin’s post).\n\nThe first main difference is that what goes into the Decoder are the outputs (the inputs shifted by one token).\nIn the Decoder, attention is masked. Only the current token and previous output tokens are “visible” to the model. Future tokens are masked. How does this masking take place? Here’s CodeEmporium’s code:\nStart by creating a 200 x 200 tensor full of negative infinity (negative infinity is used so that when you take the softmax of it, it goes to 0)\n\nmask = torch.full([max_sequence_length, max_sequence_length], float('-inf'))\nmask\n\ntensor([[-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        ...,\n        [-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [-inf, -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf]])\n\n\nKeep the upper triangle as -inf and make everything else 0 with torch.triu:\n\nmask = torch.triu(mask, diagonal=1)\nmask\n\ntensor([[0., -inf, -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [0., 0., -inf,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        [0., 0., 0.,  ..., -inf, -inf, -inf],\n        ...,\n        [0., 0., 0.,  ..., 0., -inf, -inf],\n        [0., 0., 0.,  ..., 0., 0., -inf],\n        [0., 0., 0.,  ..., 0., 0., 0.]])\n\n\nNow, when the mask is added to the scaled dot-product, the upper triangle will go to -inf (since anything plus -inf is -inf). Taking the softmax of that to get the attention matrix will result in a matrix with an upper triangle of zeros:\n\nscaled_dot_product = scaled_dot_product + mask\nscaled_dot_product[0][0]\n\ntensor([[-9.5668e-01,        -inf,        -inf,  ...,        -inf,\n                -inf,        -inf],\n        [-3.3439e-01, -1.0772e+00,        -inf,  ...,        -inf,\n                -inf,        -inf],\n        [-2.8391e-01,  2.7374e-02,  7.6844e-01,  ...,        -inf,\n                -inf,        -inf],\n        ...,\n        [ 3.8771e-04, -2.7279e-01,  3.2622e-01,  ..., -1.5672e-01,\n                -inf,        -inf],\n        [ 9.1237e-01,  9.8978e-01,  8.4105e-02,  ...,  7.8569e-01,\n         -1.8654e-03,        -inf],\n        [-8.3207e-01, -1.6773e-01, -8.6295e-01,  ..., -3.1891e-01,\n         -7.7460e-01, -8.4962e-01]], grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)\n\n\n\nF.softmax(scaled_dot_product, dim=-1)[0][0]\n\ntensor([[1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000,  ..., 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        [0.6776, 0.3224, 0.0000,  ..., 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        [0.1912, 0.2610, 0.5477,  ..., 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        ...,\n        [0.0049, 0.0037, 0.0068,  ..., 0.0042, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        [0.0073, 0.0079, 0.0032,  ..., 0.0065, 0.0029, 0.0000],\n        [0.0031, 0.0060, 0.0030,  ..., 0.0052, 0.0033, 0.0030]],\n       grad_fn=<SelectBackward0>)\n\n\nCross Attention works differently—the “Cross” in Cross Attention is talking about the relationship between the Encoder and Decoder. Specifically, the \\(K\\) and \\(V\\) weights are applied to the Encoder outputs and the \\(Q\\) weights are applied to the Decoder outputs. The rest of the process (scaled dot product, softmax, concatenation, linear layer) are the same as before (with the addition of adding the mask to the scaled dot product).\nAfter passing the through Cross Attention, the outputs go through Dropout and Layer Normalization, then a Feed Forward Network, and then through another Dropout and Layer Normalization step. The inputs to the Layer Normalization call are the residual_x plus x, which is said to stabilize the training process.\nFinally, the outputs go through a final linear layer which projects the outputs to the vocabulary size and then a final softmax call which converts those logits to probabilities per vocabulary token (in other words, answering the question: what are the probabilities that the next token will be each token in the vocabulary?)\nThere are a lot of details that I have left out of this post for brevity so to get the full Transformers code experience, see Benjamin’s commented-transformers repository, and CodeEmporium’s Encoder/Decoder notebooks."

The paper does a great job of helping the reader visualizing the concepts in play, especially the process involved in calculating scaled dot-product attention across multiple heads. The number excellent resources available that I’ve referenced throughout this blog post are also essential to understanding the code and concepts involved.\nOn a personal note, I recall going to a presentation on this paper a few years ago and leaving feeling so incredibly lost, and that maybe I wouldn’t understand how this critical architecture actually works—like I had hit a wall of complexity that I wouldn’t be able to overcome. Reading this paper, understanding it, presenting on it and writing this blog post felt like redemption for me. I obviously couldn’t have done it without the excellent resources I’ve linked above.\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed this paper summary!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this notebook I’ll walk through some of the math involved in the research paper KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization. Here’s the abstract:\n\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner; for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases – the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them being human-aware loss functions (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences – only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive.\n\nThe key difference between KTO and other methods (such as RLHF or DPO) is that instead of using preference data, KTO uses a binary signal of desirable or undesirable, as seen in the dataset example on the HuggingFace KTO Trainer page (where True = desired and False = undesired):\nkto_dataset_dict = {\n    \"prompt\": [\n        \"Hey, hello\",\n        \"How are you\",\n        \"What is your name?\",\n        \"What is your name?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n    ],\n    \"completion\": [\n        \"hi nice to meet you\",\n        \"leave me alone\",\n        \"I don't have a name\",\n        \"My name is Mary\",\n        \"Python\",\n        \"C++\",\n        \"Java\",\n    ],\n    \"label\": [\n        True,\n        False,\n        False,\n        True,\n        True,\n        False,\n        False,\n    ],\n}\nIn the following sections I walk through some of the math in the paper to get a better understanding of the concepts behind them."

From the paper:\n\nIntuitively, KTO works because if the model increases the reward of a desirable example in a generic way, then the KL penalty will also rise and no progress will be made on the loss.\n\nI think “generic way” has a negative connotation in this statement, meaning that the model is not increasing the reward in the specific way that \\(\\pi_{ref}\\), the supervised fine-tune reference model, was trained to generate outputs in (for whatever the use case is—helpful, honest, harmless, etc.).\nFrom the paper:\n\nWe do not back-propagate through the KL term, as it makes training much more stable. This means that the KL term purely serves to control how saturated the loss is. (emphasis mine)\n\nChatGPT:\n\nWhen the loss for a deep learning model is described as “saturated,” it typically means that the model has reached a point where further training does not significantly decrease the loss anymore. In other words, the model has learned as much as it can from the available data, and additional training iterations are unlikely to improve its performance significantly.\n\nI think it’s correct to say that \\(r_{KTO}\\) is like the KL divergence between the policy being trained and the reference policy across all input/output training data pairs, while \\(z_{ref}\\) is the KL divergence between the policy being trained and the reference policy across all reference data pairs. I think it’s also correct to continue that logic to say that as \\(r_{KTO}\\) increases, the policy being trained diverges from the reference policy (on training data), and \\(z_{ref}\\) keeps that divergence in check (if the policy being trained diverges too far from the reference policy on the reference data, the loss increases or stays the same).\n\n\nKTO Loss for Undesirable Outputs\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta, \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\lambda_U\\big(1 - \\sigma(z_{ref} - r_{KTO})\\big)\\big]\\]\nThis has the same \\(1-\\sigma(x)\\) form. If the reward for an UNdesirable output increases while the KL term \\(z_{ref}\\) stays the same, the loss will increase.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding \\(z_{ref}\\)\nFrom the paper:\n\nRather than having just one dispreferred generation \\(y_l|x\\) as the reference point, we assume that humans judge the quality of \\((x,y)\\) in relation to all input-output pairs they have seen.\n\nThe phrase “rather than having just one dispreferred generation \\(y_l|x\\) as the reference point” I think is referring to the DPO loss function, specifically the second term inside log sigmoid:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{DPO}(\\pi_\\theta; \\pi_{ref}) = -\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l)\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\log\\sigma\\big(\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_w|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)} - \\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)}\\big)\\big]\\]\nWhich in the KTO loss function is captured by \\(z_{ref}\\) across all \\(y'\\) outputs, not just \\(y_l\\):\n\\[z_{ref}= \\mathbb{E}_{x'\\sim\\mathcal{D}}[\\beta KL(\\pi_\\theta(y'|x')||\\pi_{ref}(y'|x'))]\\]\nI may be taking that phrase from the paper too literally, so I may be wrong about this.\nFrom the paper:\n\nwe write the reference point to be the expected reward under the optimal policy, not just for generation following \\(x\\) but following any input \\(x': \\mathbb{E}_{x' \\sim \\mathcal{D}, y \\sim \\pi^*}\\big[ r^*(x',y')\\big]\\). Under the assumption that the expected value of the partition function across \\(x'\\) is zero, this simplifies to the KL divergence between \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(\\pi_{ref}\\) scaled by \\(\\beta\\).\n\nWhere\n\\[r^*(x,y) = \\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi^*(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)} + \\beta\\log Z(x)\\]\nbecomes:\n\\[z_{ref}= \\mathbb{E}_{x'\\sim\\mathcal{D}}[\\beta KL(\\pi_\\theta(y'|x')||\\pi_{ref}(y'|x'))]\\]\nand I think it’s correct to rewrite \\(z_{ref}\\) as the following (ChatGPT agrees):\n\\[z_{ref}= \\mathbb{E}_{x'\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\beta \\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y'|x')}{\\pi_{ref}(y'|x'))}\\big]\\]\nLast thing about \\(z_{ref}\\):\nthe expectation is across \\(x'\\) only (i.e. \\(\\mathbb{E}_{x' \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\)). From ChatGPT:\n\nthis expression is dependent on \\(y'\\). Both \\(\\pi_\\theta(y'|x')\\) and \\(\\pi_{ref}(y'|x')\\) are conditional probability distributions where the probability of \\(y'\\) depends on \\(x'\\). So, the KL divergence between these two distributions also depends on \\(y'\\) indirectly through \\(x'\\). However, \\(z_{ref}\\) itself does not directly depend on \\(y'\\), as it represents the expected value of the KL divergence over all possible values of \\(x'\\)."

When it’s stated that “\\(Q_x\\) places all mass on \\(x\\)” and “\\(Q_y\\) places all mass on the dispreferred output \\(y_l\\) for \\(x\\) such that \\(y \\succ y_l\\),” it means that these distributions are highly concentrated on specific values.\nLet’s break it down:\n\\(Q_x\\) is a distribution over inputs \\(x\\). Saying that it places all mass on \\(x\\) means that it assigns a probability of 1 to a particular input \\(x\\) and 0 to all other possible inputs. In other words, \\(Q_x\\) is a degenerate distribution that only considers a single input \\(x\\).\nSimilarly, \\(Q_y\\) is a distribution over outputs \\(y\\). However, in this case, it places all mass on the dispreferred output \\(y_l\\) for a given input \\(x\\). This means that for every input \\(x\\), \\(Q_y\\) assigns a probability of 1 to the dispreferred output \\(y_l\\) and 0 to all other possible outputs. Additionally, it’s mentioned that \\(y \\succ y_l\\), which indicates that the preferred output \\(y\\) is preferred over \\(y_l\\).\n\nIf that is correct, then I would add the following to complete the construction of DPO loss as the HALO expression:\nSince \\(y \\succ y_l\\), I interpret that \\(y\\) in \\(r_\\theta(x,y)\\) corresponds to \\(y_w\\) and is represented in the DPO loss function by the term \\(\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_w|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)}\\).\nThen because \\(\\mathbb{E}_{x'\\sim Q'_x, y' \\sim Q'_y}[r_\\theta(x',y')]\\) is subracted from \\(r_\\theta(x,y)\\) in the generic HALO expression, it corresponds to \\(\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)}\\) in the DPO loss function.\nI am not confident about this last part. I’m also not going to do a walkthrough of the SLiC and PPO-Clip loss functions since I haven’t read those papers."

We’re left with:\n\\[\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\big(\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)}\\big) = \\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\big(log\\pi_\\theta(y|x) - \\log\\pi_{ref}(y|x)\\big)\\]\nThe reference model is not changing (i.e it’s not parameterized by \\(\\theta\\) and is not being trained) so its derivative with respect to \\(\\theta\\) is 0. That leaves us with:\n\\[\\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\]\nMultiplying by \\(\\frac{d}{dz}\\sigma(z)\\) to get the complete \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sigma(z)\\):\n\\[\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sigma(z) = -\\lambda_D\\sigma(z)\\sigma(-z)\\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\]\nPutting it back in the full form of the loss gradient:\n\\[\\nabla_\\theta\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta. \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\big[ -\\lambda_D \\sigma(z) \\sigma(-z) \\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\big]\\]\nWhich seems equivalent to the gradient of the KTO loss provided in the paper (although I’m not sure why they have \\(\\beta\\) inside the gradient symbol \\(\\nabla\\)):\n\\[\\nabla_\\theta\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta. \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\big[ \\lambda(y) \\sigma(z) \\sigma(-z) \\nabla \\beta \\log \\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\big]\\]\nNext, I’ll derive the gradient of the loss function for undesirable \\(y\\) values, starting with the loss function:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta, \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\lambda_U\\big(1 - \\sigma(z_{ref} - r_{KTO})\\big)\\big] = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y\\sim\\mathcal{D}}\\big[\\lambda_U\\big(1 - \\sigma(-z)\\big)\\big]\\]\nWhere\n\\[z = r_{KTO}(x,y) - z_{ref}\\]\nso \\[-z = z_{ref} - r_{KTO}(x,y)\\]\nThe derivative of \\(\\lambda_U(1-\\sigma(-z))\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\) I’ll write as:\n\\[\\frac{dz}{d\\theta} \\times \\frac{d}{dz}\\lambda_U(1-\\sigma(-z))\\]\nThe derivative of \\(\\lambda_U(1-\\sigma(-z))\\) with respect to \\(z\\) involves pulling out the constant \\(\\lambda_U\\), pulling out the constant -1 from \\(-\\sigma(z)\\), multiplying by -1 (chain rule), and the derivative of 1 with respect to \\(\\theta\\) going to 0:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dz}\\lambda_U(1-\\sigma(-z)) = \\frac{d}{dz}\\lambda_U(1-\\sigma(-z)) = -1 \\times -1 \\times \\lambda_U\\frac{d}{dz}\\sigma(-z) = \\lambda_U\\frac{d}{dz}\\sigma(-z)\\]\nGiven that \\(\\sigma(-z) = 1 - \\sigma(z)\\):\n\\[\\lambda_U\\frac{d}{dz}\\sigma(-z) = \\lambda_U\\sigma(-z)(1 - \\sigma(-z))= \\lambda_U\\sigma(-z)\\big[1 - (1-\\sigma(z))\\big] = \\lambda_U\\sigma(-z)\\big[1-1+\\sigma(z)\\big] = \\lambda_U\\sigma(-z)\\sigma(z)\\]\nThe derivative of \\(z\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\) is the same as before:\n\\[\\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\]\nMultiplying the two derivative terms together:\n\\[\\lambda_U\\sigma(-z)\\sigma(z)\\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\]\nPlugging it all back to get the loss gradient function for undesired outputs:\n\\[\\nabla_\\theta\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta. \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\big[ \\lambda_U \\sigma(z) \\sigma(-z) \\nabla \\beta \\log \\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\big]\\]\nComparing that to the loss derivative for desired outputs, the difference is the minus sign:\n\\[\\nabla_\\theta\\mathcal{L}_{KTO}(\\pi_\\theta. \\pi_{ref}) = \\mathbb{E}_{x, y \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\big[ -\\lambda_D \\sigma(z) \\sigma(-z) \\beta\\frac{d}{d\\theta}log\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\big]\\]\nThe intuition behind the minus sign given in the paper:\n\nif \\(y\\) is desirable, then \\(\\lambda(y)\\) is negative and we push up the probability of \\(\\pi_\\theta(y|x)\\) to minimize the loss; we do the opposite if \\(y\\) is undesirable.\n\nProposition 4.1 states that “KTO does not learn from undesirable examples with sufficiently high rewards or desirable examples with sufficiently low rewards” and the paper explains that:\n\nAs \\(z\\) tends to \\(\\pm\\infty\\), the gradient will tend to zero since either \\(\\sigma(-z)\\) or \\(\\sigma(z)\\) will tend to zero. Since \\(z\\) is increasing in the reward, this means that sufficiently large and sufficiently small rewards will yield a gradient of zero."

    "text": "In this blog post I’ll provide a summary (and an exploration of some of the math) for the research paper ORPO: Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model.\nHere’s the abstract:\n\nWhile recent preference alignment algorithms for language models have demonstrated promising results, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains imperative for achieving successful convergence. In this paper, we study the crucial role of SFT within the context of preference alignment, emphasizing that a minor penalty for the disfavored generation style is sufficient for preference-aligned SFT. Building on this foundation, we introduce a straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. We demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that the odds ratio is a sensible choice for contrasting favored and disfavored styles during SFT across the diverse sizes from 125M to 7B. Specifically, fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO on the UltraFeedback alone surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models with more than 7B and 13B parameters: achieving up to 12.20% on AlpacaEval2.0 (Figure 1), 66.19% on IFEval (instruction-level loose, Table 6), and 7.32 in MT-Bench (Figure 12). We release code and model checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO-\\(\\alpha\\) (7B) and Mistral-ORPO-\\(\\beta\\) (7B)."

    "text": "Gradient of ORPO Loss\nI’ll go through some of the intuition provided in the paper around the gradient of the ORPO loss function, which contains two factors: \\(\\delta(d)\\) and \\(h(d)\\) which are functions of the dataset \\(d\\) which contains inputs \\(x\\), desired responses \\(y_w\\) and undesired responses \\(y_l\\).\n\n\n\\(\\delta(d)\\)\nI’ll start by looking at \\(\\delta(d)\\) first: when the odds of the desired responses are relatively higher than the undesired responses, this term will converge to 0.\nIn the desmos graph below, \\(x\\) represents the odds ratio and so \\(\\delta(d)\\) takes the form of \\(\\frac{1}{1+x}\\):\n\nFor the following concept:\n\n\\(\\delta(d)\\) will play the role of a penalty term. accelerating the parameter updates if the model is more likely to generate the rejected responses.\n\nI found the following rearranging of \\(\\delta(d)\\) terms more intuitive:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[1 + \\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}\\big]^{-1}\\]\nI’ll replace \\(1\\) with an equivalent fraction that has the same denominator as the odds ratio:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)} + \\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}\\big]^{-1}\\]\nNow I can easily add together the fractions inside the brackets because they have the same denominator:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x) + \\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}\\big]^{-1}\\]\nRaising a fraction to the \\(-1\\) power is the same as flipping it:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x) + \\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}\\big]\\]\n\nI find this form of \\(\\delta(d)\\) more intuitive. Here you can directly see that as the odds of generating rejected responses (the numerator) increases, the overall fraction increases and thus the gradient increases, accelerating the parameter update.\n\n\n\\(h(d)\\)\nThe second term of the ORPO loss gradient is \\(h(d)\\) which has the form:\n\\[h(d) = \\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_w|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_w|x)} - \\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_l|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_l|x)}\\]\n\nFor the chosen responses, this accelerates the model’s adaptation toward the distribution of chosen responses as the likelihood increases.\n\nAs the likelihood of chosen reponses (\\(P_\\theta(y_w|x)\\)) increases, the denominator (\\(1-P\\)) decreases and the first fraction increases, increasing the gradient and accelerating the model’s adaptation toward predicting chosen responses.\nOn the other hand, as the likelihood of the rejected response increases the denominator decreases and the second fraction increases, decreasing the gradient and slowing down the model’s adapation toward the rejected response distribution.\nI’ve summarized the behavior of the two terms below:\n\nI see these two terms, \\(\\delta(d)\\) and \\(h(d)\\), contrasting each other and keeping the gradients from vanishing or exploding."

First, replace \\(1\\) with an equivalent (rejected odds divided by rejected odds):\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}  + \\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)} \\big]^{-1}\\]\nNow that they have the same denominator, add the fractions:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x) +\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)} \\big]^{-1}\\]\nTaking the inverse (exponent of \\(-1\\)), flips the fraction:\n\n\\[\\delta(d) = \\big[\\frac{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x)}{\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_l|x) +\\textbf{odds}_\\theta P(y_w|x)} \\big]\\]\nI find this version more intuitive as it’s easier to see that as the odds of generating rejected responses increases, \\(\\delta(d)\\) increases. As the odds of generating favored responses increases, \\(\\delta(d)\\) decreases.\n\nWhen the odds of the favored responses are relatively higher than the disfavored responses, \\(\\delta(d)\\) will converge to 0.\n\n\nThis indicates that \\(\\delta(d)\\) will play the role of a penalty term, accelerating the parameter updates\nif the model is more likely to generate the rejected responses.\n\nFull form of \\(h(d)\\):\n\\[h(d) = \\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_w|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_w|x)} - \\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_l|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_l|x)}\\]\n\n\\(h(d)\\) implies a weighted contrast of the two gradients from the chosen and rejected responses. Specifically, \\(1-P(y|x)\\) in the denominators amplifies the gradients when the corresponding side of the likelihood \\(P(y|x)\\) is low. For the chosen responses, this accelerates the model’s adaptation toward the distribution of chosen responses as the likelihood increases.\n\nThe last sentence (that I bolded) clarifies the concept (that the previous sentence muddied for me). As \\(P_\\theta(y_w|x)\\) increases, \\(1 - P_\\theta(y_w|x)\\) decreases (towards 0) and the fraction \\(\\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_w|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_w|x)}\\) increases (i.e. “this accelerates the model’s adaptation toward the distribution of chosen responses as the likelihood increases.”).\nConversely, as \\(P_\\theta(y_l|x)\\) increases (the likelihood of the model generating rejected responses), \\(1 - P_\\theta(y_l|x)\\) decreases (towards 0) and the fraction \\(\\frac{\\nabla_\\theta\\log P_\\theta(y_l|x)}{1-P_\\theta(y_l|x)}\\) increases. \\(h(d)\\) gets smaller, slowing the parameter updates since the model is more likely to generate the rejected responses.\nMy takeaway from the explanation of \\(\\delta(d)\\) and \\(h(d)\\) is that they are opposing forces that keep each other in check. If the model is more likely to generate rejected responses, \\(\\delta(d)\\) accelerates the parameter updates (i.e. increases the gradient) and \\(h(d)\\) slows down the parameter updates (decreases the gradient). If the model is more likely to generate favored responses, \\(\\delta(d)\\) slows down the parameter update (decreases the gradient) and \\(h(d)\\) accelerates the parameter update (increases the gradient). The intuition (I think) is that if either term gets too large or too small, the other term counters it so you don’t have vanishing or exploding gradients."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post I’ll walk through some of the math involved in the research paper Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model.\nThe abstract:\n\nWhile large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.\n\nDPO involves preference data, a reference model and the parameterized model (i.e. the model being trained).\nI found this section of the paper provide the most intuition about why DPO works:\n\nAs the model gets more likely to pick the preferred response, the gradient increases. Conversely, as the implicit reward (log probability ratio of parameterized model and reference model) for rejected responses increases, the gradient increases. I think of these two terms contrasting each other, keeping the gradient from vanishing or exploding.\nIn the next few sections of this blog post, I’ll walk through parts of the paper where I found that math either challenging (and used Claude or ChatGPT to help me figure it out) and/or particulary helpful for my understanding of the concepts. In the final section, I do my best to connect the code implementation of DPO loss with the math formulas provided in the paper. Overall I found this process very rewarding and built my confidence to take on understanding the mathy parts of the paper moving forward."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this notebook I’ll walk through some of the math involved in the research paper KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization. Here’s the abstract:\n\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner; for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases – the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them being human-aware loss functions (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences – only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive.\n\nThe key difference between KTO and other methods (such as RLHF or DPO) is that instead of using preference data, KTO uses a binary signal of desirable or undesirable, as seen in the dataset example on the HuggingFace KTO Trainer page (where True = desired and False = undesired):\nkto_dataset_dict = {\n    \"prompt\": [\n        \"Hey, hello\",\n        \"How are you\",\n        \"What is your name?\",\n        \"What is your name?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n        \"Which is the best programming language?\",\n    ],\n    \"completion\": [\n        \"hi nice to meet you\",\n        \"leave me alone\",\n        \"I don't have a name\",\n        \"My name is Mary\",\n        \"Python\",\n        \"C++\",\n        \"Java\",\n    ],\n    \"label\": [\n        True,\n        False,\n        False,\n        True,\n        True,\n        False,\n        False,\n    ],\n}\nIn the following sections I walk through some of the math in the paper to get a better understanding of the concepts behind them."

In this paper, we study the crucial role of SFT within the context of preference alignment, emphasizing that a minor penalty for the disfavored generation style is sufficient for preference-aligned SFT. Building on this foundation, we introduce a straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. We demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that the odds ratio is a sensible choice for contrasting favored and disfavored styles during SFT across the diverse sizes from 125M to 7B. Specifically, fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO on the UltraFeedback alone surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models with more than 7B and 13B parameters: achieving up to 12.20% on AlpacaEval2.0 (Figure 1), 66.19% on IFEval (instruction-level loose, Table 6), and 7.32 in MT-Bench (Figure 12).

Here’s the abstract:\n\nReward models (RMs) are at the crux of successful RLHF to align pretrained models to human preferences, yet there has been relatively little study that focuses on evaluation of those reward models. Evaluating reward models presents an opportunity to understand the opaque technologies used for alignment of language models and which values are embedded in them. To date, very few descriptors of capabilities, training methods, or open-source reward models exist. In this paper, we present RewardBench, a benchmark dataset and code-base for evaluation, to enhance scientific understanding of reward models. The RewardBench dataset is a collection of prompt-win-lose trios spanning chat, reasoning, and safety, to benchmark how reward models perform on challenging, structured and out-of-distribution queries. We created specific comparison datasets for RMs that have subtle, but verifiable reasons (e.g. bugs, incorrect facts) why one answer should be preferred to another. On the RewardBench leaderboard, we evaluate reward models trained with a variety of methods, such as the direct MLE training of classifiers and the implicit reward modeling of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and on a spectrum of datasets. We present many findings on propensity for refusals, reasoning limitations, and instruction following shortcomings of various reward models towards a better understanding of the RLHF process."

In our case, this value is 0.1.\nNext, I’ll run through the lines of code in LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy’s forward method if reduction='none' (which is the case for our Excel example), and show that it outputs the same values as Excel.\n\neps=0.1\nc = output.size()[1]\nlog_preds = F.log_softmax(output, dim=1)\nloss = -log_preds.sum(dim=1)\nloss*eps/c + (1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction='none')\n\ntensor([0.3314, 2.1951, 2.3668, 1.2633, 1.9855])\n\n\nHere, c is the number of classes (2)."

    "text": "Bringing it All Together\nThe Excel calculation that I recreated in PyTorch and the fastai implementation look different but achieve the same result. I’ll try to connect and reason through the two approaches.\nThe first two lines of interest in LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy are straightforward—they define constants used later on.\n\neps=0.1\nc = output.size()[1]\neps, c\n\n(0.1, 2)\n\n\nIn the next line, log_preds is defined as:\n\nlog_preds = F.log_softmax(output, dim=1)\nlog_preds\n\ntensor([[-1.3595e-03, -6.6014e+00],\n        [-1.0508e-01, -2.3051e+00],\n        [-8.6836e-02, -2.4868e+00],\n        [-1.3133e+00, -3.1326e-01],\n        [-2.0830e+00, -1.3302e-01]])\n\n\nIn Excel, we fold this step into the following formula (multiplying the noisy labels with the log probabilities and summing both classes):\n\nlog_preds is just the LN(I2) and LN(J2) parts in the Excel formula for each image (or row).\nThe next line in LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy sums the log probabilities across each row (or image) and multiplies the sum by negative 1.\nIn Excel, this is would be the same as the part of the formula with the noisy labels removed: =-LN(I2)-LN(J2).\n\n\nloss = -log_preds.sum(dim=1)\nloss\n\ntensor([6.6027, 2.4102, 2.5737, 1.6265, 2.2160])\n\n\nThe last part is where the noisy label magic happens in PyTorch.\nloss*eps/c + (1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction='none')\nIn the first term, loss*eps/c, the log probabilities summed across both classes for each image is multiplied by 0.1/2 or 0.05:\n\nloss*eps/c\n\ntensor([0.3301, 0.1205, 0.1287, 0.0813, 0.1108])\n\n\nThe second term, (1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction='none') does a couple of things:\nFirst, it calculates the negative log likelihood loss given the log probabilities (log_preds) and the targets. Note that all nll_loss does is pick out the log_preds items at the target indices for each row:\n\nF.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction='none')\n\ntensor([1.3595e-03, 2.3051e+00, 2.4868e+00, 1.3133e+00, 2.0830e+00])\n\n\nSince reduction is 'none', this is the same as just indexing each row with our target tensor and multiplying by -1:\n\n-1 * log_preds[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], target]\n\ntensor([1.3595e-03, 2.3051e+00, 2.4868e+00, 1.3133e+00, 2.0830e+00])\n\n\n\nlog_preds # reminder of what log_preds looks like\n\ntensor([[-1.3595e-03, -6.6014e+00],\n        [-1.0508e-01, -2.3051e+00],\n        [-8.6836e-02, -2.4868e+00],\n        [-1.3133e+00, -3.1326e-01],\n        [-2.0830e+00, -1.3302e-01]])\n\n\n\ntarget # reminder of what target looks like\n\ntensor([0, 1, 1, 0, 0])\n\n\nSo, basically, nll_loss with reduction='none' takes the 0-th element of the first row (-1.3595e-03), the 1-th element in the second row (-2.3051e+00) and so on. nll_loss picks only the chosen label’s probabilities, whereas loss is the sum of both class’ probabilities.\nThe chosen probabilities are then multiplied by 1-eps or 0.90.\nLet’s visualize what that last line in LabelSmoothCrossEntropy is doing, row by row, given the log_preds values. I’ve rewritten loss as -log_preds.sum(dim=1).\n(-log_preds.sum(dim=1))*eps/c + (1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction='none')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrow\n-log_preds.sum(dim=1)*eps/c\n(1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction=‘none’)\n\n\n\n\n1\n-(-1.3595e-03 + -6.6014e+00) * 0.05\n0.90 * 1.3595e-03\n\n\n2\n-(-1.0508e-01 + -2.3051e+00) * 0.05\n0.90 * 2.3051e+00\n\n\n3\n-(-8.6836e-02 + -2.4868e+00) * 0.05\n0.90 * 2.4868e+00\n\n\n4\n-(-1.3133e+00, -3.1326e-01) * 0.05\n0.90 * 1.3133e+00\n\n\n5\n-(-2.0830e+00, -1.3302e-01) * 0.05\n0.90 * 2.0830e+00\n\n\n\nIn each row you’ll notice that the target log probability is multiplied first by 0.05 (which is eps/c) and then multiplied by 0.90 (which is 1-eps) and then added together. We can rewrite this as follows (adding together 0.05 and 0.90 to get 0.95 for the target class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrow\n-log_preds.sum(dim=1)*eps/c + (1-eps) * F.nll_loss(log_preds, target.long(), reduction=‘none’)\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.05 * 6.6014e+00 + 0.95 * 1.3595e-03\n\n\n2\n0.05 * 1.0508e-01 + 0.95 * 2.3051e+00\n\n\n3\n0.05 * 8.6836e-02 + 0.95 * 2.4868e+00\n\n\n4\n0.05 * 3.1326e-01 + 0.95 * 1.3133e+00\n\n\n5\n0.05 * 1.3302e-01 + 0.95 * 2.0830e+00\n\n\n\nI’ll expand the Excel version a bit more to match this form so we can see the parallels:\n\nIn this way, the fastai implementation, Aman Arora’s Excel implementation and my PyTorch implementation are visualized and aligned."

    "text": "In Chapter 8 of the fastai text we train a collaborative filtering model that predicts movie ratings for users (who have not watched those movies yet). It’s one way of asking the question: would this user like this movie given their interests and the movie’s characteristics? The users’ “interests” and the movies’ “characteristics” are the latent factors that we train. The ratings (predictions) are the dot product between the user and movie latent factors. This dot product passes through the sigmoid_range function which squeezes the input values into output values within a given range. In the textbook, the range we use is 0 to 5.5. We use 5.5 because the sigmoid function never reaches 1 so 5 * sigmoid would never reach 5 (the maximum movie rating). Overshooting by 0.5 solves this issue. 5.5 times sigmoid will be able to reach an output of 5 comfortably.\nIn this blog post I’ll explore the question: how does model performance vary as y_range varies?\nHere is a summary of my results of different statistics (rows) for different y_range values (columns) for the validation set (20k samples):\n\n\n\nStatistic\nNone\n(0, 5.5)\n(0.5, 5.5)\n(0.75, 5.25)\n(1,5)\n(-2,8)\n\n\n\n\nMedian Prediction\n3.49\n3.53\n3.54\n3.54\n3.53\n3.55\n\n\nMean Prediction\n3.43\n3.48\n3.5\n3.5\n3.49\n3.51\n\n\nKurtosis\n0.78\n-0.06\n-0.1\n-0.11\n-0.14\n0.12\n\n\nSkew\n-0.59\n-0.39\n-0.34\n-0.36\n-0.38\n-0.32\n\n\nAnderson-Darling\n71.7\n42.4\n33.4\n37\n42\n21.8\n\n\n% preds outside 1-5\n0.93%\n0.23%\n0.21%\n0.07%\n0.00%\n1.19%\n\n\n\nAnd for the training set (80k samples):\n\n\n\nStatistic\nNone\n(0, 5.5)\n(0.5, 5.5)\n(0.75, 5.25)\n(1,5)\n(-2,8)\n\n\n\n\nMedian Prediction\n3.50\n3.60\n3.60\n3.60\n3.59\n3.63\n\n\nMean Prediction\n3.44\n3.49\n3.50\n3.50\n3.50\n3.52\n\n\nKurtosis\n0.42\n0.15\n0.003\n0.003\n-0.06\n0.2\n\n\nSkew\n-0.49\n-0.61\n-0.53\n-0.56\n-0.56\n-0.5\n\n\nAnderson-Darling\n228.9\n490.4\n388.1\n444.8\n467.6\n350.4\n\n\n% preds outside 1-5\n0.68%\n0.31%\n0.23%\n0.05%\n0.00%\n1.85%"

It was helpful to see intuitive results being validated through observing the actual prediction distributions (for example, y_range=(1,5) had 0 prediction outside of that range while y_range=(-2,8) had the most.\nThere were some surprises along the way: a y_range of (-2,8) had the lowest training loss—not sure what to make of that—a y_range of (1,5) resulted in the second-best loss (perhaps because there is a smaller range to predict within?) and although the none of distributions were normal, there were varying degrees of non-normality.\nAs part of the fastai Part 1 Lesson 7 homework, I’ll be training models on the full MovieLens dataset (~25M rows) so it’ll be fun to experiment with y_range values and see if I get different results.\nI hope you enjoyed this blog post!"

    "text": "In fastai Part 1 Lesson 7 (Chapter 8 of the textbook), we are introduced to the concept of weight decay, where the sum of the squared weights multiplied by a factor wd is added to the loss. In practice, instead of adding wd times the sum of squared weights to the loss (which would result in a large values of loss which destabilizes training), we add the derivative of that to the parameters’ gradients. In pseudo code:\nfor param in model.parameters():\n  param.grad += wd * sum(params)\nBy increasing the loss with the squared sum of weights, we are forcing the model to minimize the weights when it minimizes the loss, which makes the model generalize better (as large weights result in a neural net function with sharp peaks and troughs that can overfit to the training data).\nIn this notebook I’ll train on the MovieLens 100k dataset using different values of weight decay and then plotting both the resulting training and validation loss curves and weight distribution to see how weight decay affects the training process and the resulting model."

    "text": "Analyzing Training Results\n\nmatplotlib Animations\nI’ll create an animation with matplotlib which highlights the training loss curve for each weight decay value and prints the weight decay value on the plot.\nTo start, I’ll make sure that all 360 of my training loss lists are of the same length (6250 steps).\n\n#wd_res = load_pickle('/content/wd_res.pkl')\n\n\ntrn_loss_t = torch.stack([torch.tensor(el) for el in wd_res['training_loss']])\n\n\ntrn_loss_t.shape # looks good\n\ntorch.Size([360, 6250])\n\n\nNext, I’ll create my x values for the plot as a range from 0 to 6249.\n\nx = list(range(len(wd_res['training_loss'][0])))\nlen(x), x[:5], x[-5:]\n\n(6250, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6245, 6246, 6247, 6248, 6249])\n\n\nWith ChatGPT’s help, I used the following code to create an animated GIF which highlights the training and validation loss curves for the given weight decay value.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation, PillowWriter\n\n# Prepare Data\nx = list(range(len(wd_res['training_loss'][0])))\n\ndata = wd_res['training_loss']\n\nlabels = wd_res['wds']\n\n# Create Static Plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.set_xlabel('Step')\nax.set_ylabel('Training Loss')\n\nlines = [ax.plot(x, y, alpha=0.0, color='#ff0088', linewidth=2)[0] for y in data]  # Initial lines with lower opacity\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 1.05, \"\", transform=ax.transAxes, ha=\"center\")\n\n# Define Animation Function\ndef animate(i):\n    # Reset all lines to low opacity\n    for line in lines:\n        line.set_alpha(0.0)\n\n    # Highlight the current line\n    lines[i].set_alpha(1.0)\n\n    # Update the text\n    text.set_text(f\"weight decay = {labels[i].item():.5f}\")\n\n    return lines + [text]\n\n# Create Animation\nani = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=len(data), interval=150, blit=True)\n\n# Save as GIF\ngif_writer = PillowWriter(fps=6)\nani.save('training_loss.gif', writer=gif_writer)\n\n\nHere’s the GIF for training loss. The loss curve slowly moves upward with the minimum loss value increasing as weight decay increases. It really starts picking up at a weight decay value of around 0.1.\n\nHere’s the GIF for the validation loss—the loss curve starts out decreasing first then increasing and at a weight decay value of around 0.03, starts decreasing monotonically with the minimum loss reaching its minimum. It starts to shift upwards again at around a loss of 0.3.\n\nNext, I’ll animate the distribution of the weights (as weight decay value changes), modifying the above code accordingly:\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation, PillowWriter\n\n# Prepare Data\ndata = wd_res['weights']\nlabels = wd_res['wds']\n\n# Create Static Plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.set_xlabel('Weights')\nax.set_ylabel('Count')\n\n# Define Animation Function\ndef animate(i):\n    ax.clear()  # Clear previous histogram\n    n, bins, patches = ax.hist(data[i].detach().numpy())\n    ax.set_title(f\"weight decay = {labels[i].item():.5f}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel('Weights')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Count')\n    ax.set_xlim(-0.5, 0.5)  # Set x-axis limits to keep consistent across frames\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 75000)  # Set y-axis limits to keep consistent across frames\n    return patches\n\n# Create Animation\nani = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=len(data), interval=150, blit=True)\n\n# Save as GIF\ngif_writer = PillowWriter(fps=6)\nani.save('weights.gif', writer=gif_writer)\n\n\nHere’s the resulting GIF showing the changing distribution of weights. Note that the range of weights starts out beyond -0.5 to 0.5, and ends up within -0.2 and +0.2 as the weight decay value increases to 1.0.\n\n\n\nTrends\nI’ll next look at how the final training loss, validation loss and median weight value changes with weight decay values.\n\nmin_trn_loss = trn_loss_t.min(dim=-1)[0]\nmin_trn_loss.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], min_trn_loss, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Minimum Training Loss')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the weight-decay value increases, so does the training loss.\n\nval_loss_t = torch.stack([torch.tensor(el) for el in wd_res['validation_loss']])\nmin_val_loss = val_loss_t.min(dim=-1)[0]\nmin_val_loss.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], min_val_loss, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Minimum Validation Loss')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum validation loss achieved during training reaches a minimum at a weight decay value of around 0.2 and then increases as weight decay increases to 1.0.\n\nweights_t = torch.stack([el.clone().detach() for el in wd_res['weights']])\nweights_t.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360, 133059])\n\n\n\nmed_weights_t = weights_t.median(dim=-1)[0]\nmed_weights_t.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], med_weights_t, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Median Weight Value')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit difficult to see trends from this chart, but the but median weights generally seem to be decreasing as weight decay value increaeses–although there is a considerable amount of variability.\n\nmean_weights_t = weights_t.mean(dim=-1)\nmean_weights_t.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], mean_weights_t, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Mean Weight Value')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean weights follow a similar trend—generally narrowing in range as weight decay value increases. I’ll look at the absolute value of mean and median and see if any trends appear:\n\nabs_med_weights_t = weights_t.abs().median(dim=-1)[0]\nabs_med_weights_t.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], abs_med_weights_t, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Median Absolute Weight Value')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s much clearer! the median absolute value of the weights exponentially decreases as the weight decay value increases. I’ll look at the mean absolute value we well:\n\nabs_mean_weights_t = weights_t.abs().mean(dim=-1)\nabs_mean_weights_t.shape\n\ntorch.Size([360])\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nplt.scatter(wd_res['wds'], abs_mean_weights_t, s=5, alpha=0.4)\n\n# Set axis labels\nplt.xlabel('Weight Decay Value')\nplt.ylabel('Mean Absolute Weight Value')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show();\n\n\n\n\n\nYup! The mean absolute value of the weights exponentially decreases as well (as weight decay value goes to 1.0)."

Recapping the trends I observed:\n\nMinimum training loss increases as weight decay increases.\nMinimum validation loss decreases until a point (for this dataset and model, until a weight decay value of ~0.2) and then increases as weight decay increases.\nThe mean and median absolute values of the final weights decreases (exponentially) as weight decay increases.\n\nI also enjoyed creating animated GIFs as a visual tool to illustrate the distributions and trends of weights and losses as weight decay increases. The resulting GIFs could be improved by tweaking frame rate and other parameters, but I’m happy with the overall trends they convey, which match the static plots I created.\nAs always, I hope you enjoyed this blog post!
