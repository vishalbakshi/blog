<p>The granular question-level results are available in <a href="https://gist.github.com/vishalbakshi/9e0dc5b83c9b02810099f53377ced4ba">this public gist</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the two metrics I use for evaluation are <strong>Score</strong> and <strong>Answer Rate</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation metric for each question, that I’m simply calling <strong>score</strong>, is binary: can the retrieved context answer the question (<code>1</code>) or not (<code>0</code>)? The evaluation metric across a set of questions, which I’m calling the <strong>Answer Rate</strong>, is the mean score for those questions.</p>
<p>While this is a straightforward pair of metrics, they do involve some judgment. After reading the retrieved context, I decide if it’s enough to answer the question.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of tags across the 29 questions where the Answer Rate for all of my semantic search methods was 0% (i.e.&nbsp;none of the methods retrieved the context needed to answer the question):</p>

<p>This notebook is a part of <a href="https://vishalbakshi.github.io/blog/#category=fastbookRAG">series of blog posts</a> for a project I’m calling fastbookRAG where I’m trying to answer questions from the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/tree/master">fastbook</a> end-of-chapter Questionnaires using the following pipeline:</p>

<section id="error-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="error-analysis">Error Analysis</h2>
<p>For 29 questions, none of the 6 semantic search methods retrieved sufficient context to provide an answer. I’ll be looking at each of those 29 questions, their “gold standard” answer (obtained from the fastai Forums Questionnaire wikis), and the relevant context from the fastbook chapter.</p>
<p>I have three objectives for this error analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what kinds of questions are difficult to answer using semantic search.</li>
<li>Identify ambigious questions that need to be removed from the evaluation set.</li>
<li>Identify unanswerable questions that need to be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overarching goal of this analysis: look at your data!</p>
<p>For each of the 29 questions, I will write four sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant Context: the paragraph(s) from the fastbook text that are sufficient to answer the question.</li>
<li>Analysis: my interpretation/explanation for why a semantic search did not retrieve the context.</li>
<li>Conclusion: what I think is needed to retrieve the sufficient context (or if I think this question should be removed)</li>
<li>Tags: keywords that describe the type of error.</li>

For most use-cases of deep learning, you will need labels for your data to compare your model predictions to. You will need a loss function that will quantitatively measure the performance of your model.

However, a lot of information can be represented as images . For example, a sound can be converted into a spectrogram, which is a visual interpretation of the audio. Time series (ex: financial data) can be converted to image by plotting on a graph. Even better, there are various transformations that generate images from time series, and have achieved good results for time series classification.

Answer: ""The predictions of the model could be reviewed by human experts for them to evaluate the results and determine what is the best next step. This is especially true for applying machine learning for medical diagnoses. For example, a machine learning model for identifying strokes in CT scans can alert high priority cases for expedited review, while other cases are still sent to radiologists for review. Or other models can also augment the medical professional’s abilities, reducing risk but still improving efficiency of the workflow.

<p>The ability of deep learning to combine text and images into a single model is, generally, far better than most people intuitively expect.

But again, we have the same warning that we discussed in the previous section: there is no guarantee that these captions will actually be correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because of this serious issue, we generally recommend that deep learning be used not as an entirely automated process, but as part of a process in which the model and a human user interact closely. This can potentially make humans orders of magnitude more productive than they would be with entirely manual methods, and actually result in more accurate processes than using a human alone. For instance, an automatic system can be used to identify potential stroke victims directly from CT scans, and send a high-priority alert to have those scans looked at quickly. There is only a three-hour window to treat strokes, so this fast feedback loop could save lives. At the same time, however, all scans could continue to be sent to radiologists in the usual way, so there would be no reduction in human input. Other deep learning models could automatically measure items seen on the scans, and insert those measurements into reports, warning the radiologists about findings that they may have missed, and telling them about other cases that might be relevant.</p>

Question Text: ""What is the difference between `item_tfms` and `batch_tfms`?""
Answer: ""item_tfms are transformations applied to a single data sample x on the CPU. Resize() is a common transform because the mini-batch of input images to a cnn must have the same dimensions. Assuming the images are RGB with 3 channels, then Resize() as item_tfms will make sure the images have the same width and height.
batch_tfms are applied to batched data samples (aka individual samples that have been collated into a mini-batch) on the GPU. They are faster and more efficient than item_tfms. A good example of these are the ones provided by aug_transforms(). Inside are several batch-level augmentations that help many models.""</code></pre>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our images are all different sizes, and this is a problem for deep learning: we don’t feed the model one image at a time but several of them (what we call a mini-batch). To group them in a big array (usually called a tensor) that is going to go through our model, they all need to be of the same size. So, we need to add a transform which will resize these images to the same size. <strong>Item transforms are pieces of code that run on each individual item, whether it be an image, category, or so forth.</strong> fastai includes many predefined transforms; we use the <code>Resize</code> transform here:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Data augmentation refers to creating random variations of our input data, such that they appear different, but do not actually change the meaning of the data. Examples of common data augmentation techniques for images are rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes and contrast changes. For natural photo images such as the ones we are using here, a standard set of augmentations that we have found work pretty well are provided with the aug_transforms function. <strong>Because our images are now all the same size, we can apply these augmentations to an entire batch of them using the GPU, which will save a lot of time. To tell fastai we want to use these transforms on a batch, we use the <code>batch_tfms</code> parameter</strong> (note that we’re not using RandomResizedCrop in this example, so you can see the differences more clearly; we’re also using double the amount of augmentation compared to the default, for the same reason):</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>My guess here is that the embedding model doesn’t know how to properly embed the terms <code>item_tfms</code> and <code>batch_tfms</code> because they are parameters to a fastai function.

Answer: ""Manual process – the model is run in parallel and not directly driving any actions, with humans still checking the model outputs.
Limited scope deployment – The model’s scope is limited and carefully supervised. For example, doing a geographically and time-constrained trial of model deployment, that is carefully supervised.
Gradual expansion – The model scope is gradually increased, while good reporting systems are implemented in order to check for any significant changes to the actions taken compared to the manual process (i.e. the models should perform similarly to the humans, unless it is already anticipated to be better).""</code></pre>

<p><strong>Relevant Context:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Where possible, the first step is to use an entirely manual process, with your deep learning model approach running in parallel but not being used directly to drive any actions. The humans involved in the manual process should look at the deep learning outputs and check whether they make sense. For instance, with our bear classifier a park ranger could have a screen displaying video feeds from all the cameras, with any possible bear sightings simply highlighted in red. The park ranger would still be expected to be just as alert as before the model was deployed; the model is simply helping to check for problems at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second step is to try to limit the scope of the model, and have it carefully supervised by people. For instance, do a small geographically and time-constrained trial of the model-driven approach. Rather than rolling our bear classifier out in every national park throughout the country, we could pick a single observation post, for a one-week period, and have a park ranger check each alert before it goes out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then, gradually increase the scope of your rollout. As you do so, ensure that you have really good reporting systems in place, to make sure that you are aware of any significant changes to the actions being taken compared to your manual process. For instance, if the number of bear alerts doubles or halves after rollout of the new system in some location, we should be very concerned. Try to think about all the ways in which your system could go wrong, and then think about what measure or report or picture could reflect that problem, and ensure that your regular reporting includes that information.</p>

<p>All of the semantic search methods retrieved context that was related to deployment, and some even retrieved the HTML image tag for the relevant “Deployment process”, but none of them retrieved the relevant paragraphs.

Question Text: ""What is SGD?""
Answer: ""SGD, or stochastic gradient descent, is an optimization algorithm. Specifically, SGD is an algorithm that will update the parameters of a model in order to minimize a given loss function that was evaluated on the predictions and target. The key idea behind SGD (and many optimization algorithms, for that matter) is that the gradient of the loss function provides an indication of how that loss function changes in the parameter space, which we can use to determine how best to update the parameters in order to minimize the loss function. This is what SGD does.""</code></pre>

<p>To be more specific, here are the steps that we are going to require, to turn this function into a machine learning classifier:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initialize the weights.</li>
<li>For each image, use these weights to predict whether it appears to be a 3 or a 7.</li>
<li>Based on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its loss).</li>
<li>Calculate the gradient, which measures for each weight, how changing that weight would change the loss</li>
<li>Step (that is, change) all the weights based on that calculation.</li>
<li>Go back to the step 2, and repeat the process.</li>
<li>Iterate until you decide to stop the training process (for instance, because the model is good enough or you don’t want to wait any longer).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We need to define first what we mean by “best.” We define this precisely by choosing a loss function, which will return a value based on a prediction and a target, where lower values of the function correspond to “better” predictions. It is important for loss functions to return lower values when predictions are more accurate, as the SGD procedure we defined earlier will try to minimize this loss. For continuous data, it’s common to use mean squared error:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As we’ve seen, we need gradients in order to improve our model using SGD, and in order to calculate gradients we need some loss function that represents how good our model is. That is because the gradients are a measure of how that loss function changes with small tweaks to the weights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Looking good! We’re already about at the same accuracy as our “pixel similarity” approach, and we’ve created a general-purpose foundation we can build on. Our next step will be to create an object that will handle the SGD step for us. In PyTorch, it’s called an optimizer.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>There are 4 chunks in the chapter needed to answer the question in a way that matches the gold standard. Each of the 4 chunks are located in a different section of the chapter (“Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)”, “An End-to-End SGD Example”, “The MNIST Loss Function”, “Putting It All Together”). Three of the semantic search methods I used retrieved only one of these four chunks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

Answer: ""A bias will compensate for the fact that some movies are just amazing or pretty bad. It will also compensate for users who often have more positive or negative recommendations in general.""</code></pre>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is a reasonable start, but we can do better. One obvious missing piece is that some users are just more positive or negative in their recommendations than others, and some movies are just plain better or worse than others. But in our dot product representation we do not have any way to encode either of these things. If all you can say about a movie is, for instance, that it is very sci-fi, very action-oriented, and very not old, then you don’t really have any way to say whether most people like it.</p>

<p>That’s because at this point we only have weights; we do not have biases. If we have a single number for each user that we can add to our scores, and ditto for each movie, that will handle this missing piece very nicely. So first of all, let’s adjust our model architecture:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>I can’t say for sure, but I feel like there’s something about how the relevant context is worded that caused a lack of similarity between the question and context embeddings. Neither paragraph chunks mention the word “bias” (the second paragraph uses the word “biases”) and the answer is not explicitly stated in a single sentence (i.e.&nbsp;“in a dot product model the bias encodes how some users are more positive or negative in their recommendations or how some movies are just plain better or worse than others”). I don’t have a strong intuition about embeddings yet and perhaps what I am suggesting is more applicable to a keyword-based search.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While this question may not be unanswerable by semantic search in general, the methods I used certainly found it impossible to answer. However, I’m not sure why this is the case.</p>

Question Text: ""How do entity embeddings reduce memory usage and speed up neural networks?""
Answer: ""Especially for large datasets, representing the data as one-hot encoded vectors can be very inefficient (and also sparse). On the other hand, using entity embeddings allows the data to have a much more memory-efficient (dense) representation of the data. This will also lead to speed-ups for the model.""</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Relevant Context:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up neural networks compared with one-hot encoding, but more importantly by mapping similar values close to each other in the embedding space it reveals the intrinsic properties of the categorical variables… [It] is especially useful for datasets with lots of high cardinality features, where other methods tend to overfit… As entity embedding defines a distance measure for categorical variables it can be used for visualizing categorical data and for data clustering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>
<p>After re-reading the question, relevant context and the gold standard answer dozens of items, I have come to conclude that this question is unanswerable given the chapter text. The questions asks <strong>how</strong> entity embeddings reduce memory usage and speed-up neural networks, but the only relevant context I found in the chapter states <strong>that</strong> “Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up neural networks…” and doesn’t explain how, as stated in the gold standard answer.</p>
<p>You could argue that the memory efficiency/inefficiency of embeddings and one-hot encoded vectors has already been addressed in Chapter 8 in the following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If we do that for a few indices at once, we will have a matrix of one-hot-encoded vectors, and that operation will be a matrix multiplication! This would be a perfectly acceptable way to build models using this kind of architecture, except that it would use a lot more memory and time than necessary. We know that there is no real underlying reason to store the one-hot-encoded vector, or to search through it to find the occurrence of the number one—we should just be able to index into an array directly with an integer. Therefore, most deep learning libraries, including PyTorch, include a special layer that does just this; it indexes into a vector using an integer, but has its derivative calculated in such a way that it is identical to what it would have been if it had done a matrix multiplication with a one-hot-encoded vector. This is called an embedding.</p>
<p>jargon: Embedding: Multiplying by a one-hot-encoded matrix, using the computational shortcut that it can be implemented by simply indexing directly. This is quite a fancy word for a very simple concept. The thing that you multiply the one-hot-encoded matrix by (or, using the computational shortcut, index into directly) is called the embedding matrix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I am not searching the entire textbook for each question, I am isolating the search for Chapter 9 questions to the Chapter 9 text.</p>
<p>I’ll also point out that for the keyword-based results, I accepted the retrieved context as sufficient to answer the question, but upon reflection I am changing my opinion on that.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This question is unanswerable given just the Chapter 9 text.</p>

Question Text: ""Summarize what a decision tree algorithm does.""
Answer: ""The basic idea of what a decision tree algorithm does is to determine how to group the data based on “questions” that we ask about the data. That is, we keep splitting the data based on the levels or values of the features and generate predictions based on the average target value of the data points in that group. Here is the algorithm:
Loop through each column of the dataset in turn
For each column, loop through each possible level of that column in turn
Try splitting the data into two groups, based on whether they are greater than or less than that value (or if it is a categorical variable, based on whether they are equal to or not equal to that level of that categorical variable)
Find the average sale price for each of those two groups, and see how close that is to the actual sale price of each of the items of equipment in that group. That is, treat this as a very simple “model” where our predictions are simply the average sale price of the item’s group
After looping through all of the columns and possible levels for each, pick the split point which gave the best predictions using our very simple model
We now have two different groups for our data, based on this selected split. Treat each of these as separate datasets, and find the best split for each, by going back to step one for each group
Continue this process recursively, and until you have reached some stopping criterion for each group — for instance, stop splitting a group further when it has only 20 items in it.""</code></pre>

Question Text: ""How are mse, samples, and values calculated in the decision tree drawn in this chapter?""
Answer: ""By traversing the tree based on answering questions about the data, we reach the nodes that tell us the average value of the data in that group, the mse, and the number of samples in that group.""</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Relevant Context:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The top node represents the initial model before any splits have been done, when all the data is in one group. This is the simplest possible model. It is the result of asking zero questions and will always predict the value to be the average value of the whole dataset. In this case, we can see it predicts a value of 10.10 for the logarithm of the sales price. It gives a mean squared error of 0.48. The square root of this is 0.69. (Remember that unless you see m_rmse, or a root mean squared error, then the value you are looking at is before taking the square root, so it is just the average of the square of the differences.) We can also see that there are 404,710 auction records in this group—that is the total size of our training set. The final piece of information shown here is the decision criterion for the best split that was found, which is to split based on the coupler_system column.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Moving down and to the left, this node shows us that there were 360,847 auction records for equipment where coupler_system was less than 0.5. The average value of our dependent variable in this group is 10.21. Moving down and to the right from the initial model takes us to the records where coupler_system was greater than 0.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The bottom row contains our leaf nodes: the nodes with no answers coming out of them, because there are no more questions to be answered. At the far right of this row is the node containing records where coupler_system was greater than 0.5. The average value here is 9.21, so we can see the decision tree algorithm did find a single binary decision that separated high-value from low-value auction results. Asking only about coupler_system predicts an average value of 9.21 versus 10.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Returning back to the top node after the first decision point, we can see that a second binary decision split has been made, based on asking whether YearMade is less than or equal to 1991.5. For the group where this is true (remember, this is now following two binary decisions, based on coupler_system and YearMade) the average value is 9.97, and there are 155,724 auction records in this group. For the group of auctions where this decision is false, the average value is 10.4, and there are 205,123 records. So again, we can see that the decision tree algorithm has successfully split our more expensive auction records into two more groups which differ in value significantly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>The gold standard answer is not explicitly stated (or even paraphrased) in the relevant context but serves as a summary of it. Especially without the image, I find that this is a difficult question to answer just based on the chapter’s text—you have to synthesize the information presented in both the text and the image and then summarize the overall process of how MSE, samples and values are calculated.</p>
<p>One of the semantic search methods did retrieve the first paragraph of the relevant context (“The top node represents the initial model…”) but I didn’t consider that sufficient to answer the question. Based just on that question (without the image and without the subsequent paragraphs) I would arrive at the conclusion that MSE, samples and values are calculated in the top node, and would not include the relevant context about traversing the tree, or how there are nodes other than the top one in the tree which contain this information.</p>
<p>I’m considering removing this question from the evals because of these reasons, but will keep it for now in case the LLM can deduce the correct answer given the first paragraph of context.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While this question may not be unanswerable by semantic search in general, the methods I used certainly found it impossible to answer. I attribute this error to this question requiring the image to answer.</p>

<p>One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>This question is asking about a specific paragraph in the chapter which explicitly states the “50,000 additional movie reviews.” None of my semantic search methods retrieved this paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While this question may not be unanswerable by semantic search in general, the methods I used certainly found it impossible to answer. My guess for why is that this question requires the keyword “50,000” to be in the answer.</p>

<p>For instance, the rules will replace a sequence of four exclamation points with a special repeated character token, followed by the number four, and then a single exclamation point. In this way, the model’s embedding matrix can encode information about general concepts such as repeated punctuation rather than requiring a separate token for every number of repetitions of every punctuation mark. Similarly, a capitalized word will be replaced with a special capitalization token, followed by the lowercase version of the word. This way, the embedding matrix only needs the lowercase versions of the words, saving compute and memory resources, but can still learn the concept of capitalization.</p>

<p>Our special rules tokens appear first, and then every word appears once, in frequency order. The defaults to <code>Numericalize</code> are <code>min_freq=3</code>,<code>max_vocab=60000</code>. <code>max_vocab=60000</code> results in fastai replacing all words other than the most common 60,000 with a special unknown word token, <code>xxunk</code>. This is useful to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, since that can slow down training and use up too much memory, and can also mean that there isn’t enough data to train useful representations for rare words. However, this last issue is better handled by setting <code>min_freq</code>; the default <code>min_freq=3</code> means that any word appearing less than three times is replaced with <code>xxunk</code>.</p>

Question Text: ""Why do we use a larger kernel in the first conv with MNIST (with simple_cnn)?""
Answer: ""With the first layer, if the kernel size is 3x3, with four output filters, then nine pixels are being used to produce 8 output numbers so there is not much learning since input and output size are almost the same. Neural networks will only create useful features if they’re forced to do so—that is, if the number of outputs from an operation is significantly smaller than the number of inputs. To fix this, we can use a larger kernel in the first layer.""</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Relevant Context:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As we discussed, we generally want to double the number of filters each time we have a stride-2 layer. One way to increase the number of filters throughout our network is to double the number of activations in the first layer–then every layer after that will end up twice as big as in the previous version as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But there is a subtle problem with this. Consider the kernel that is being applied to each pixel. By default, we use a 3×3-pixel kernel. That means that there are a total of 3×3 = 9 pixels that the kernel is being applied to at each location. Previously, our first layer had four output filters. That meant that there were four values being computed from nine pixels at each location. Think about what happens if we double this output to eight filters. Then when we apply our kernel we will be using nine pixels to calculate eight numbers. That means it isn’t really learning much at all: the output size is almost the same as the input size. Neural networks will only create useful features if they’re forced to do so—that is, if the number of outputs from an operation is significantly smaller than the number of inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To fix this, we can use a larger kernel in the first layer. If we use a kernel of 5×5 pixels then there are 25 pixels being used at each kernel application. Creating eight filters from this will mean the neural net will have to find some useful features:</p>

<p>This is a complex topic and the relevant context needed to answer this question is relatively large. To match the gold standard answer, the three paragraphs must be summarized as the answer is not explicitly or simply stated.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While this question may not be unanswerable by semantic search in general, the methods I used certainly found it impossible to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> difficult question</p>

<p>Here is a summary of tags across the 29 questions where the Answer Rate for all of my semantic search methods was 0% (i.e.&nbsp;none of the methods retrieved the context needed to answer the question):</p>

<p>The most common error was due to <code>unknown failure</code> (12) where I didn’t have a guess for why semantic search failed. I attribute this to my lack of experience using embeddings.</p>
<p>The next most common error type was <code>chunking strategy</code> (9). These were situations where the relevant context needed to match the gold standard answer was longer than 3 paragraphs or spread out across multiple sections in the chapter.</p>
<p>There were 4 <code>keyword-based question</code>s where the question and relevant context contained a specific keyword (like <code>show_batch</code> or “50,000”). I felt these were better suited for a keyword-based search.</p>
<p>The relevant context for the 2 <code>difficult question</code>s did not explicitly state/paraphrase the gold standard answer and required inferring/summarization. With the right prompting, a capable LLM could handle this correctly.</p>
<p>The 2 <code>unanswerable</code> questions were those where the corresponding chapter text did not contain the answer, and required external knowledge (including other chapters of the book).</p>
<p>Finally, 1 question required an image to achieve the gold standard answer.</p>
<p>I’m curious to see for which of these questions keyword-based search yielded better results (and vice versa). I’ll be analyzing that next.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of how many 0% Answer Rate questions there are for each chapter. Semantic search struggled considerably in retrieving relevant context for Chapter 9 and 10 questions.</p>
