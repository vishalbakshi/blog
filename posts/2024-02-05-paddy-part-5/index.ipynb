In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition.

Do everything you can on smaller images, as long as it gets you reasonable results, because you want to iterate quickly. Then, when you want the best accuracy you try bigger and bigger images and see what you can get away with--keep doing that as long as the accuracy improves. In a production environment it's similar, you make it bigger and bigger until the latency of the model is too high, and you find the right trade-off between model latency and accuracy. Generally speaking, larger images will give you more accurate results but a lot slower (you end up with a lot more pixels from 224^2 to 360^2). For initial iterating you don't need a really accurate model because you are trying to figure out what data preprocessing works best, or what architecture works best. In a business context, Jeremy would do exactly what he has done here---try a few things on small fast models on small images on a small subset of the data to find out what data preprocessing and architecture to use, and then he would look at what are the constraints in operationalizing this (how much RAM do we have, how much latency can we get away with, how expensive is it going to be) to scale it up to the point where we are getting acceptable results using acceptable resources. It wouldn't look very different at all than a Kaggle competition in terms of the modeling, but there would be a whole piece of it around user requirements, costs, and stuff like that. \n","\n","One student tried going from smaller to larger models but it resulted in lower accuracy (note: this is what essentially happened to me, except for the large ensemble with 3-times weighted vit model which matches the small ensemble's private score), is it just a fluke? No, it's not a fluke. It means you pressed the wrong buttons somehow. Re-run Jeremy's notebooks and then look at yours and see how they're different. And then figure out where you went wrong. When debugging, look at the inputs and outputs---what predictions are you making? For example are you always predicting 0? Did you run `lr.find` to see what learning rate works well?

are of the \"ADT45\" variety. But there are ~3k rows that contain other varieties. Something that is a bit counterintuitive: when there's two different things (what kind of rice is it, what kind of disease is it) sometimes trying to get your model to predict two different things makes tham better at both. This sounds counterintuitive because you are giving it more work to do but you are also giving it more signal---things you're teaching it to look for. So maybe if it knows how to recognize different kinds of rice, it can use that information to also recognize how different kinds of rice are impacted by different diseases. No idea if this is going to be useful or not but it would be an interesting exercise to try to do that. Also a good exercise of delving into models in a way we haven't done before. This is going to be much more sophisticated than anything we've done with deep learning before. It's a really good test of how well you understand what's going on inside a neural network.\n","\n","Jeremy trained a model three times to see what the error rate was, to see what kind of variation there is. A learning rate of 0.02 for 3 epochs gave consistent results. People are often into doing reproducible training where they have set the seed for their training and run the same thing everytime. I think that's normally a bad idea because I actually want to see what the natural variation is and so **if I make a change I want to know if the difference I see in the result is due to natural variation or it's actually something significant.** If the natural variation is very large, it's going to be tough to see if you actually improved things. But then if the natural variation is so large that improvements are invisible then trying to improve it seems pointless because it sounds like you haven't really found a way to stably train something. And normally that happens because the learning rate is too big. If you bump the learning rate to 0.04 you'll see the error rate go all over the place (5%, 6^, etc.). Training for more epochs at a lower learning rate will generally give you more stable results. There's a compromise because doing more epochs is slow. You could also try using a smaller subset of the data. In the end sometimes things will just be slow but most of the time Jeremy finds that you can get a compromise. \n","\n","With 6 epochs at half the learning rate (0.01) the model is more accurate (4% error rate rather than 5%).\n","\n","These improvements you make on a small scale show up on a larger scale. They pretty much always will because they are the same models with more layers or wider activations. If you find some preprocessing step that works well on a convnext tiny, it's going to work also well on a convnext larg, 99.9% of the time. Most people act as if that's not true, like in academia, or most people never think to try. But intuitively, of course it's the same. Why wouldn't it be the same? It's the same model just scaled up a bit that behaves very similarly. You can argue that it's intuitive, but it might not be intuitive because everybody has told you for years that it doesn't work that way."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["I'll run
