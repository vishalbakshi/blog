In this blog post, I have written excerpts and some notes from the book *Visualization Analysis & Design* by Tamara Munzner.

# Preface

Book recommendations:

-   Envisioning Information (Tufte)

-   Information Visualization: Perception for Design (Ware)

-   Visual Thinking for Design (Ware)

-   Data Visualization (Ward)

-   Data Visualization (Telea)

## Structure: What's in This Book

-   Chapter 1: high-level introduction to an analysis framework of breaking down vis design to *what-why-how* questions that have *data-task-idiom* answers

-   Chapter 2: addresses the *what* question with answers about data abstraction

-   Chapter 3: addresses the *why* question with task abstractions

-   Chapter 4: extends the analysis framework to two additional levels: the domain situation level on top and the algorithm level on the bottom

-   Chapter 5: the principles of marks and channels for encoding information

-   Chapter 6: eight rules of thumb for design

-   Chapter 7: how to visually encode data by arranging space for tables

-   Chapter 8: for spatial data

-   Chapter 9: for networks

-   Chapter 10: choices for mapping color and other channels in visual encoding

-   Chapter 11: ways to manipulate and change a view

-   Chapter 12: ways to facet data between multiple views

-   Chapter 13: how to reduce the amount of data shown in each view

-   Chapter 14: embedding information about a focus set within the context of overview data

-   Chapter 15: six case studies

# Chapter 1: What's Vis, and Why Do It?

Computer based visualization systems provide visual representation of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

Vis usage can be analyzed in terms of why the user needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed.

### 1.2 Why Have a Human in the Loop?

Vis allows people to analyze data when they don't know exactly what questions they need to ask in advance.

If a fully automatic solution has been deemed to be acceptable, then there is no need for human judgment, and thus no need for you to design a vis tool.

The outcome of designing vis tools targeted at specific real-world domain problems is often a much crisper understanding of the user's task, in addition to the tool itself.

### 1.3 Why Have a Computer in the Loop?

By enlisting computation, you can build tools that allow people to explore or present large datasets that would be completely unfeasible to draw by hand, thus opening up the possibility of seeing how datasets change over time.

As a designer, you can think about what aspects of hand-drawn diagrams are important in order to automatically create drawings that retain the hand-drawn spirit.

### 1.4 Why Use an External Representation?

Vis allows people to offload internal cognition and memory usage to the perceptual system, using carefully designed images as a form of external representations, sometimes called external memory.

### 1.5 Why Depend on Vision?

The visual system provides a very high-bandwidth channel to our brains. A significant amount of visual information processing occurs in parallel at the preconscious level.

Sound is poorly suited for providing overviews of large information spaces compared with vision. We experience the perceptual channel of sound as a sequential stream, rather than as a simultaneous experience where what we hear over a long period of time is automatically merged together.

### 1.6 Why Show the Data in Detail?

Statistical characterization of datasets is a very powerful approach but it has the intrinsic limitation of losing information through summarization.

Anscombe's Quartet illustrates how datasets that have identical descriptive statistics can have very different structures that are immediately obvious when the dataset is shown graphically.

### 1.7 Why Use Interactivity?

When datasets are large enough, the limitations of both people and display preclude just showing everything at once.

### 1.8 Why is the Vis Idiom Design Space Huge?

**idiom**: a distinct approach to creating and manipulating visual representations.

### 1.9 Why Focus on Tasks?

A tool that serves well for one task can be poorly suited for another, for exactly the same dataset.

Reframing the users' task from domain-specific form into abstract form allows you to consider the similarities and differences between what people need across many real-world usage contexts.

### 1.10 Why Focus on Effectiveness?
