Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Lorena does not flip the coin. Shana does not flip the coin. Priscilla does not flip the coin. Summer does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse""'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Problem understanding:
- The question asks whether the coin remains heads up even though no one flipped it (reversed its position). In other words, if we know that initially the coin was heads up, but no one has performed any action on it since then, would the coin remain in a heads-up position or not?

Variables and their values:
- Coin position: Initially heads up (value of 1)
- Flipping actions: None performed for all individuals mentioned in the prompt (values of 0)

Plan: Calculate the new value of the coin based on the given information.

Calculation: If there are no changes made to the initial state (heads up), then the final value should be the same as the initial value. Since none of the people listed have flipped the coin, the final value of the coin can only depend on the initial value. Therefore, the final value of the coin must also be heads up with a value of 1.

Solution: Yes, the coin will remain heads up because no one has reversed its position. The final value of the coin is still 1.

Note: This problem seems straightforward, however, always pay careful attention to the language used in problems like this to avoid misunderstandings. For instance, ""flips"" in the context of coins could mean either physically turning over the coin or changing the outcome of a coin toss from heads to tails, so clarify which meaning applies before proceeding with your solution.",1

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We know that a coin can be flipped to either heads or tails. However, in this scenario, we are specifically referring to flipping the coin as reversing its orientation (i.e., turning it over).
2. Since none of the individuals mentioned in the question have flipped the coin, it remains in its original position and orientation.

Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse""'",Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! Let's tackle this problem together. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Understand the problem: The problem states that a coin is initially heads up, but no one flips it. We need to determine whether the coin remains heads up or changes to tails.
2. Extract variables and numerals:
	* Coin: C
	* Person who did not flip the coin: L, S, P, Sum
3. Plan: Since none of the people mentioned in the problem flipped the coin, we can conclude that the coin has not changed its orientation. Therefore, the final state of the coin will be the same as its initial state, which is heads up.
4. Calculation:
Let C = heads up (initially)
Since no one flipped the coin, the final state of the coin remains unchanged, i.e., C = heads up
5. Intermediate calculations: None required
6. Solution: The coin remains heads up after not being flipped by any of the persons listed in the problem. Therefore, the final state of the coin is C = heads up.
7. Answer: Yes, the coin is still heads up.

Let's use logical reasoning to determine whether the coin is still heads up after each person has been given the opportunity to flip it without actually doing so.

1. The coin starts as heads up.
2. Lorena does not flip the coin, so nothing changes (the coin remains heads up).
3. Shana does not flip the coin, so the coin remains heads up.
4. Priscilla does not flip the coin, so the coin stays heads up.

The question states that a coin is initially heads up, but it doesn't specify who flipped it or how long ago it was flipped. So we can assume that the coin has been heads up for some time before the events described in the question began.
2. Lorena, Shana, Priscilla, and Summer do not flip the coin. This means they don't reverse its orientation, so the coin remains heads up as far as we know.
3. However, since none of these individuals have flipped the coin, there could be other factors at play that might change its orientation. For example, someone else could have flipped the coin, or an external force like wind or gravity could cause it to rotate and land on a different side.

1. Understand the problem: The problem states that there are five people - Walter, Mikayla, Larry, Ryan, and the coin. The coin is initially heads-up. None of these individuals flips the coin, but they all do something to it. We need to determine whether the coin remains heads-up or not.
2. Extract variables and numerals:
	* Variable: Coin (C)
	* Numeral: Heads (H) or Tails (T)
3. Plan: Since none of the individuals flip the coin, we can assume that no one changes its initial state. Therefore, if any of them touches the coin, it must be to reverse its orientation (i.e., flip it). So, our goal is to find out if the coin was reversed at any point in time.
4. Calculate intermediate results:
	* Step 1: Check if any of the individuals touched the coin.
		+ If yes, proceed to Step 2. Otherwise, skip to Step 5.
	* Step 2: Determine if the individual who touched the coin reversed the coin's orientation.
		+ If yes, the coin is now tails-up; otherwise, it remains heads-up.
5. Solve the problem step by step:
	* Walter did not touch the coin, so move on to the next person.
	* Mikayla did not touch the coin either, so continue to the next person.
	* Larry did not touch the coin, so the coin's status remains unchanged.
	* Ryan did not touch the coin, so the coin's status also remains unchanged.
6. Show the answer: Since none of the individuals touched the coin, the coin's original state (heads-up) remains unchanged. Therefore, the final answer is: Yes, the coin is still heads-up.

If there were no additional flips, determine whether the final orientation of the coin is still H based on the initial state and the actions taken.

Calculation and Common Sense: None of the listed individuals flipped the coin. Therefore, we can assume that the final orientation of the coin remains as it was at the beginning, which is Heads Up. However, since the term ""flip"" actually refers to ""reversing,"" this could also mean that the coin remained Heads Up because none of them reversed it. It's unclear from the original statement whether someone else might have flipped the coin during the process, but without additional context or information, we cannot make that assumption either way.

Problem Statement: Take the last letter of each word in the phrase ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"" and concatenate them.

Step-by-step Plan:

Last Letters,"'Take the last letters of each words in ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"" and concatenate them'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"In this case, there is no need for calculations or intermediate steps since we are only dealing with string manipulation. The question asks us to take the last letter of each word from the given name and concatenate them.

Firstly, we split the string into individual words using spaces as delimiters. This gives us an array containing each word separately.

```javascript
let input = ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"";
let arr = input.split("" "");
console.log(arr);
// Output: [""Jacky"", ""Socorro"", ""Mark"", ""Wanda""]
```

Next, we can loop through the array `arr` starting at index 0 and ending at index `length - 1`, taking the last character of each word and storing it in a new empty variable called `lastLetters`. To get the last character of each word, we can use `slice()` method which takes two arguments, the start index (inclusive) and end index (exclusive). In our case, the start index will always be `-1` (the last index) and the length of the word as the second argument (since we want to slice up until one less than the end).

```javascript
let input = ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"";
let arr = input.split("" "");
let lastLetters = """"; // Initialize empty string to store last characters
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    lastLetters += arr[i].slice(-1)[0]; // Adding the result of the slice operation to lastLetter variable
}
console.log(lastLetters);
// Output: ""aydkn""
```

The output shows that the last letters of each word have been concatenated together. Note how we used the bracket notation `[]` on the result returned by the `slice()` function to access its value inside another pair of square brackets. We also appended the resulting value to the `lastLetters` variable inside the loop body using the `+=` operator. Finally, we printed the final result `lastLetters` to console.",0

1. Understand the problem: The problem is asking us to take the last letter of each word in the sentence ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"" and concatenate them together. So, we need to work with the individual words in the sentence and their respective letters.

	* Mariel (6)
	* Aditya (7)
	* Elisabeth (9)
3. Decide on a plan: Since we are dealing with a sequence of words, one possible way to approach this problem is to use a loop that iterates over each word in the sentence and calculates its last letter. Then, we can concatenate all these letters together using a concatenation operator.
4. Carry out the plan: Here's how we can implement the plan:
```
# Define the words in the sentence as strings
words = [""Lino"", ""Mariel"", ""Aditya"", ""Elisabeth""]

# Initialize an empty string to store the concatenated letters
concatenated_letters = """"

# Loop through each word in the sentence
for word in words:
    # Get the last letter of the current word

    # Add the last letter to the concatenated letters string
    concatenated_letters += last_letter

# Print the concatenated letters
print(concatenated_letters)

SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! Let's dive into this problem together. Here are the details we have been given:

* After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly.
* Each person paid $45.

Our goal is to find the total amount of the bill. To do this, we need to use our understanding of division and calculate the total cost based on the number of people involved.

Let's start by identifying the key variables in the problem:

* Number of people = 3 (Sally, Sam, and Alyssa)
* Amount each person pays = $45

Now, let's create a plan to solve the problem:

1. Determine the total cost of the meal by multiplying the number of people by the amount each person pays.
2. Check if the result makes sense based on the information provided.

Great, let's move on to step 1!

Total cost = Number of people x Amount each person pays
= 3 x $45
= $135

Is the result reasonable based on the information provided? Yes, it does seem like a reasonable amount for three people to pay for a meal.

So, the total amount of the bill was $135.

Did you notice any patterns or relationships between the numbers as we solved the problem? For example, did you notice that the total cost increased by $45 for every additional person? This could be useful knowledge to apply to similar problems in the future.",1
SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Each person contributed $45 to split the cost equally among them.
2. Since there were three people sharing the bill (Sally, Sam, and Alyssa), we can calculate how much one third ($30) would be using division with a remainder set equal to zero since there is no remainder for dividing by three:
    - Bill divided by number of people = Cost per person
        - Total Bill / Number of People = Cost Per Person
        - Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People

Using this formula:

- Total Bill / Number of People = Cost Per Person
- Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People

Let's plug in our known values:

Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People
      = $45 x 3
      = $135

So, if each person paid $45, then they collectively spent $135 on their meal.",1

```
We know that each person pays $45, so we can rewrite the equation as follows:

SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Let's assume that there were three items on the menu with prices $x$, $y$, and $z$. Since they split it equally, each person had to pay for one-third of the total cost of those three dishes. Therefore, we can set up a system of equations as follows:

1st Person (Sally) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$
2nd Person (Sam) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$
3rd Person (Alyssa) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$

Adding all these payments together gives us the total price of their meal.

Total Price = $x/3 + x/3 + x/3 + y/3 + y/3 + y/3 + z/3 + z/3$
= $(x+y+z)/3 * 3$
= ($x+y+z$)

Now, let's use this formula in our problem statement. Each person paid $45$ so we can find out how much money they spent on those three items by dividing $45$ by $3$:

Each person paid $(1/3)*(total\ cost)$
So if Sally, Sam, and Alyssa each paid $45$, then:

$(1/3)*(total\ cost) = 45$
Multiplying both sides by $3$:

$(total\ cost) = 3*45$

Therefore, the total cost of their meal would be $135$ which means that the three items cost $135$ when split between them. We don't know exactly how much each item costs, but we do know that they added up to $135$.

Note that you could also solve for the individual costs using algebraic methods. However, this method may not always provide an exact solution depending on your input data. For example, if two people ordered the same dish but one got dessert while the other didn't, finding out the exact cost per person becomes more difficult.

Also, we can assume that the bill is greater than zero since it represents a real-world scenario where someone has spent money on food. Therefore, let's start with a multiple of 3 for our guess:

Guess: The total bill is $135.

Now, let's check if this guess works out when divided equally among the three friends:
$135 / 3 = $45

If Sally, Sam, and Alyssa divided the bill evenly, that means they each paid $45. So, if we multiply the number of people by the amount each person paid, we can find the total cost of the bill:

Total cost = Number of people x Amount each person paid

SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's assume that there were X number of items on the menu for the three individuals to share equally. Each item costs Y dollars per serving or portion. Therefore, the total cost of all the shared items would be calculated as follows:

X * Y = Total Cost of Shared Items

Each individual shares an equal amount of this total cost. So if each person pays Z dollars, we can find Z using the following formula:

Z/3 = Total Cost of Shared Items / 3

Substituting for the previously found expression for ""Total Cost of Shared Items"" gives us:

(X * Y) / 3 = Z

In our example, Z is known because each person paid $45. Substitute it into the equation above:

$45 = (Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)/3

To isolate the unknown value of Number of Items (X), we need to perform some algebraic manipulations. First, multiply both sides of the equation with 3:

$(Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)*3=135$

Then divide both sides by $(Dollar Amount Per Serving)$:

$(Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)*3/(Dollar Amount Per Serving)=135/$($Dollar Amount Per Serving)$

The last expression simplifies to X*3=135/$($Dollar Amount Per Serving)$

So, to determine how many items they ordered in total, we divide 135 by ($Dollar Amount Per Serving$) multiplied by 3. For instance, suppose that each dish costs $20. The number of dishes that the group ordered will then be:

X*3=(135/$20)/3

X*(1)=6.75

However, since you cannot order half a dish, round up to get the nearest integer, so the total number of dishes is 7.

Therefore, the group ordered 7 dishes altogether that they split evenly among themselves. To find the price per dish, we simply take the dollar amount for one serving ($20) and divide by 7, which equals approximately $2.86.

If the total cost of the meal was $45 per person, then they must have spent $135 collectively on the seven meals, or $19.29 per dish. This means that they ended up over-ordering slightly by paying $1.29 more than the true average cost per dish. However, considering that food prices tend to fluctuate, a small discrepancy such as this should not cause any significant financial loss for the restaurant or inconvenience for its customers.",0

In this case, we can create an equation using the given information:

Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = Total Carrots (Good + Bad)

Now, if there are a total of 38 good carrots, then the remaining ones must be bad. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of Good Carrots = Number of Good Carrots for Carol + Number of Good Carrots for Mom
38 = 29 (for Carol) + 9 (Remaining Good Carrots for Mom)

Subtracting the number of good carrots found earlier from our original equation, we get:

Total Carrots - Total Good Carrots = Total Bad Carrots
x - 38 = Total Bad Carrots

Using substitution with the variable 'x', we can solve for the total bad carrots:

Original Equation:
Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = Total Carrots (Good + Bad)
(29 for Carol) + (16 for Mom) = x (Total Carrots)

New Equation (adding both equations):
x - 38 = Total Bad Carrots
(29 for Carol) + (16 for Mom) + (x - 38) = Original Equation

If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! Let's dive into this problem together. Here are the details we need to work with:

* Carol picked 29 carrots from the garden.
* Her mother picked 16 carrots from the same garden.
* Only 38 of the total carrots were good (i.e., not bad).

Our goal is to find out how many bad carrots Carol and her mother had combined. To do this, we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Identify what we know about the number of good carrots. We know that 38 of the total carrots were good, so we can write an equation:

Good Carrots = Total Carrots - Bad Carrots

where Good Carrots is the number of good carrots Carol and her mother picked, and Total Carrots is the total number of carrots they picked.

Step 2: Find out how many bad carrots Carol picked. Since Carol picked 29 carrots, and only 38 of them were good, then she must have picked some bad ones too. So, we can write:

Bad Carrots = 29 - Good Carrots

Now, we know that Carol picked 29 carrots, but only 7 (which is 29 minus 38) of them were good.

Step 3: Find out how many bad carrots her mother picked. Similarly, since her mother picked 16 carrots, and only 38 of the total carrots were good, then her mother must have picked some bad ones too. So, we can write:

Bad Carrots = 16 - Good Carrots

Now, we know that her mother picked 16 carrots, but only 4 (which is 16 minus 38) of them were good.

Step 4: Add up the number of bad carrots Carol and her mother picked to get the total number of bad carrots they had. In other words, we add the values of Bad Carrots from Steps 2 and 3:

Total Bad Carrots = Bad Carrots + Bad Carrots
= 7 + 4
= 11

Therefore, Carol and her mother had 11 bad carrots in total.

Q: Does the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exist?

A: To find the answer to this question, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem statement is asking us to determine whether the country that won the most gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics still exists today.

Step 2: Extract Relevant Variables and Numerals
From the problem statement, we can identify the following variables:

* Year of the Olympics: 1976
* Number of gold medals awarded:?

We don't have any numerical values yet, but we will soon obtain them from reliable sources.

Step 3: Devise a Plan
Our plan is to gather information about the number of gold medals awarded to each country at the 1976 Summer Olympics. We can use official Olympic reports or reputable sports websites as our primary sources. Once we have this information, we can compare it with the current list of countries to see which one won the most gold medals in 1976.

Step 4: Carry Out the Plan
Let's start by searching for the official Olympic report for the 1976 Summer Games. After some research, I found the report on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) website. According to the report, the United States won the most gold medals at the 1976 Olympics with 39 total medals, including 10 gold medals.

Now, let's check if the United States still exists as a country. Yes, it does! The United States of America is still a sovereign nation, founded on July 4, 1776, and has been a member of the IOC since 1894.

Let's assume that B bottles also cost $A cents per bottle.

So, the cost of B bottles = $A cents / B bottles
= $A cents x 100 / B bottles

Now, let's choose the correct answer from the options provided:

(A) AB/2700 : This option multiplies both A and B by 2700, which gives us a total cost of $59,400 for 27 bottles. However, this is not the correct answer as it exceeds the maximum value allowed ($100AB/27).

(B) 27/AB : This option divides 27 by the number of bottles B, which gives us a cost of $A cents per bottle. Since we know that 27 bottles cost $A cents, this means that B bottles would cost half that amount, or $A/2 cents each.

(C) AB/270 : This option divides the total cost by the number of bottles A, which gives us a cost of $A cents per bottle. However, since we know that 27 bottles cost $A cents, this means that B bottles would cost twice that amount, or $2A cents each.

(D) 2700/AB : This option divides the maximum allowable value by the number of bottles B, which gives us a cost of $100AB/27 bottles. While this is within the range of values allowed, it is still not the correct answer as it does not take into account the fact that 27 bottles cost $A cents.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 27/AB, which gives us a cost of $A cents per bottle for B bottles.",0
AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let x represent the number of bottles of soda that costs B cents each.

The given information is:
- The price for 27 bottles of soda is A cents.
   - To convert this into dollars, we need to divide by 100 since one cent equals $0.01.
   
- We want to find the price per bottle for x bottles.
   - This can be calculated as: price per bottle = total price / number of bottles

Total price for 27 bottles is A cents or $A/100.
Number of bottles for x is x.
Price per bottle for x is equal to the total price divided by the number of bottles: $((A/100)/x)*100$
But we are looking for cents, not dollars. So we need to multiply it by 100 again: $(A/(100*x))*100$.

To get from dollars to cents, we just drop the dollar sign, so our final answer is:
$(A/(100*x))$

Now back to your question, if you have B bottles instead of X, then using the formula above with B replacing x:

price per bottle for B bottles = ($(A/100)/B)*100$

This gives us an expression in terms of A and B. However, we're trying to find the price per bottle in dollars based on B's price per bottle (in cents). Therefore, we would like to simplify this expression further by solving for the price per bottle in cents and then converting that to dollars. Let's do that now:

1. Simplifying the expression:

First, note that to cancel out ""100"" in the denominator, we can take its reciprocal which is ""1/100"". Doing so yields:

price per bottle for B bottles = ((A/100)/B)*100*(1/100)$

We can combine the last two factors inside parentheses:

price per bottle for B bottles = (A/100^2)*B$

Next, let's factor out ""A"":

price per bottle for B bottles = (A/100^2)*(B/100)$

Finally, let's simplify this expression:

price per bottle for B bottles = (BA^{-2})*100^-3$$

2. Converting to dollars:

Now we know the price per bottle in terms of cents; however, we'd like to express this value in dollars. For that, we simply divide the value obtained in cents by 100 (since there are 100 pennies in every dollar):

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2}/100^3) * (1/100)$

Simplifying this equation:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = BA^{-2}*10^-5$

Thus, the formula for finding the price per bottle in dollars when purchasing B bottles at a rate of A cents per bottle is:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2})*10^-5$

Returning to your original question, here's what you were asking:

If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?

Solution: Use the newly derived formula to determine the price per bottle in dollars based on buying B bottles at a rate of A cents per bottle. Plugging in the values provided, we obtain:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2})*10^-5$

Substituting the known quantities:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (B*A^{-2})*10^-5$

Therefore, the cost in dollars for B bottles is found by multiplying the resulting price per bottle for B bottles in dollars by B. In other words, C=BCp, where C represents the total cost for B bottles in dollars, and Cp is the price per bottle in dollars, which was determined previously. I hope that helps clarify things!

Using these conversion factors, we can calculate the cost of B bottles as follows:

So, if 27 bottles of soda cost $X cents, we want to find out how much B bottles will cost in dollars. Here are the given options for solving the problem:

(A) AB/2700 - This option involves dividing the cost of 27 bottles ($X cents) by the number of bottles (27). However, since we don't know the value of X yet, we can't use this option.

(B) 27/AB - This option involves dividing the cost of 27 bottles ($X cents) by the number of bottles (B). Since we don't know the value of B yet either, we cannot use this option.

(C) AB/270 - This option involves dividing the cost of 27 bottles ($X cents) by the number of bottles (270). However, this is not a valid solution because it would result in a price per bottle that is lower than zero.

(D) 2700/AB - This option involves dividing the total cost of 2700 bottles ($X dollars) by the number of bottles (B). However, again, we don't know the value of B yet, so we cannot use this option.

(E) 100AB/27 - This option involves multiplying the cost of 27 bottles ($X cents) by 100 and then dividing the result by the number of bottles (B). However, this is also not a valid solution because it would result in a price per bottle that is higher than infinity.

Now, let's think about how we can approach this problem. We know that the cost of 27 bottles is $X cents, but we don't know the value of X yet. To find out the cost of B bottles, we need to divide the cost of 27 bottles by the number of bottles. So, let's call the unknown variable representing the cost of one bottle ""x"".

Therefore, the equation we can use to solve the problem is:

$X = xB

Now, we have two equations:

* The cost of 27 bottles is $X cents
* The cost of B bottles is xB dollars

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:

$X = xB

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by B:

x = $X / B

Now, we finally have the value of x, which represents the cost of one bottle. Therefore, the cost of B bottles is:

Bottles Cost = $X / B = x

So, the correct answer is (E) 100AB/27.",0
AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"(A) AB/2700 

Explanation: Let's say the price per bottle for both scenarios is x. In scenario 1 (given), we have:
   - Total cost = $27 * x (since there are 27 bottles)
   - Therefore, x can be found by dividing the total cost ($27) by the number of bottles (27):
      x = $27 / 27 = $1 per bottle

In scenario 2, let's assume that B bottles costs y. We want to find out what value of y would result in a total cost of $x * B when each bottle costs $x. By setting up a proportion and solving it using cross-multiplication, we get:
   
   $y$/$x$ = $B$$b$/$A$
   --- Cross Multiply ---
   $y$*$A$ = $B$$x$
   $y$ = $(B$$x$) / $A$
   $y$ = ($B$ * $1$) / $A$
   $y$ = ($B$ / $A$) * $1$ (per bottle)

Since the question asked about ""cost in dollars"", we need to convert this final answer from ""$"" per bottle to ""$"" for all B bottles. So, multiplying by B gives us:
   $y$ = ($B$ / $A$) * $1$ per bottle * $B$ total bottles
   $y$ = ($B^2$ / $A$) dollars for all B bottles

Therefore, the formula to calculate the cost per bottle (in ""$"") is:
   Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($Cost To Buy X Number Of Bottles (Total Dollars Spent)/Number Of Bottles Purchased)

We can rearrange this formula to solve for y (the total cost if we buy B bottles). Here's where our original calculation comes in handy. Since we already know that one bottle costs $1$, plugging in these values into the previous formula yields:
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = $B$ * $1$ (per bottle) * $B$ total bottles
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = $B^2$ dollars

Now, using the information given in the question, we can substitute this formula with variables instead of numbers:
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = AB^2 / A^2 * $2700 (from Scenario 1)
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = AB / 2700 * $2700
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($AB$) / 2700 dollars

Finally, to make sure we answered the correct question, we need to divide the total cost for buying all B bottles by the number of bottles bought (which is B). This gives us the average or mean cost per bottle. But since they ask for the cost in dollars, not just the cost per bottle, we don't take the last step. Instead, we simply return the calculated value as the final answer.

The formula for calculating the cost per bottle if you purchase B bottles at a price of $X per bottle is:
   Average Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($B^2$ * $X$) / ($A^2$ * $2700$)

So, returning back to our problem:

Let's use the provided values:
- X = $1$ (price per bottle in Scenario 1)
- A = 27 (number of bottles purchased in Scenario 1)
- B =? (variable representing number of bottles being considered now)

Substituting those known values above into the previously derived formula gives us:

   Average Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($B^2$ * $1$) / ($27^2$ * $2700$)

But this isn't quite what was requested; we wanted the total cost for purchasing B bottles. Fortunately, we only need to modify the numerator slightly to achieve this goal!
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($B$ * $1$) / ($A$ * $2700$)
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($B$ / $A$) * $2700$ / 1 dollar per bottle (Scenario 1)",0

The formula is: Number of dollars = (Number of cents) / 100

For 27 bottles, the total number of cents would be: (Price per bottle × Number of bottles) or AC. So, let's plug this into our formula above and solve for x.

x = AC / 100 * B

Here's where we introduce some abbreviations to simplify things:
- C stands for the ""price per bottle"" for question A
- B stands for the ""number of bottles"" that we want to calculate the cost for

What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Firstly, calculate how many students are left after selecting those who chose Contemporary Dance (let's call this group ""Group A""). This is done by finding 80% (the complement to 20%) of the total number of students (which we can assume for now to be 20). So, Group A has `(20 * 0.8) = 16` students.

2. Next, find out how many of the students from Group A have chosen Jazz Dance (this will help us determine the size of another subgroup called ""Group B"" that includes all students choosing both Contemporary AND Jazz dances). To do so, take the size of Group A, which is 16, multiply it with the proportion of students choosing Jazz Dance in that group (0.25), which gives you `(16 * 0.25) = 4`. Therefore, there are 4 students in Group B.

3. The final step involves determining the total number of students who choose Hip-Hop Dance. Since we know that all other students not included in either Group A or Group B have selected Hip-Hop as their preferred dance form, we add up these two groups - Group C (remaining students from the original set of 20 minus the ones in Groups A & B) plus the four students from Group B. Here's the math:

   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = ((20 - 16) + 4)`
   
   Where the first part calculates the number of students in Group C and the second part adds the students in Group B. Simplifying the formula using parentheses, we get:
   
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (4 - 16 + 4)`
   
   Now let's simplify further:
    
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (-12 + 4)`
   
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (-8)`
   
   However, since percentages cannot be negative, the question needs some adjustment. Percentage calculation requires dividing the numerator by the denominator and then multiplies it by 100%. That means we need to turn our result into a positive value. We can achieve this by doing the opposite operation on the given expression. Instead of looking at the amount of students choosing Hip-Hop Dance, let's look at the portion of the entire class that doesn't select Hip-Hop Dance. That way, we would have calculated the complement of what we were originally asked to calculate.

   For example, if 20% choose contemporary dance, 75% don't choose contemporary dance. If we want to convert any percentage figure back to its decimal equivalent, we divide the percentage figure by 100. And when dealing with ratios or proportions, we keep them in terms of decimals. Hence, instead of dealing with percentages, we use decimal values. Using similar logic to the one above, to find the percentage of the entire class that does NOT select Hip-Hop Dance, follow these steps:
     
      1. Calculate the portion of the class that chooses neither Contemporary nor Jazz Dancing; i.e., the students who only choose Hip-Hop Dance. Do this by subtracting the numbers of students who chose Contemporary (from Group A) and Jazz (from Group B) from the original class size. The remaining students belong to Group C. 
        
        `Students Not Selecting Hip-Hop Dance = Total Number Of Students - [Number Of Students Chosen Contemporary + Number Of Students Chosen Jazz]`
        
        `= 20 - [(16 × 0.2) + (4)]`
        
        `= 20 - 12`
        
        `= 8`
        
        There are 8 students in Group C, which include those who prefer either Contemporary OR Jazz but haven't opted for Hip-Hop Dance.
        
        Now, to find out what percentage of the entire class chooses neither Contemporary nor Jazz Dancing (i.e., the non-hip hop group), divide the number of students belonging to Group C by the total number of students and then multiply the result by 100.
        
        `Percentage Of Entire Class Not Choosing Hip-Hop Dance = ([Total Number Of Students - (Number Of Students Chosen Contemporary + Number Of Students Chosen Jazz)] / Total Number Of Students) x 100`

Number of Students Enrolled in Jazz Dance = Percentage of Students Remaining x Number of Students After Taking Away Those Who Are Enrolled in Contemporary Dance
                                           = 0.25 x 16
                                           = 4

Remaining Students After Taking Away Those Who Enrolled in Contemporary Dance or Jazz Dance = Total Number of Students - (Students Enrolled in Contemporary Dance + Students Enrolled in Jazz Dance)
                                             = 20 - (4+4)
                                             = 8

Let's find the number of students that enroll in Hip Hop Dance. We know there were originally 8 students left who didn't take either contemporary or jazz. If none took hip hop initially, then this is the maximum possible value for ""students enrolling in hip hop"" from here onward. However, since we have been given percentages rather than raw numbers so far, we need to convert what we do know about the other two categories into similar terms before proceeding with our calculation. To translate the remaining students not involved in either contemporary or jazz dance as a percentage of the original group, divide the number of those remaining by the total student count, i.e., the initial percentage was 8/20 or 40%. Now, if we assume no overlap between these three groups, then any one of them could be selected independently; in other words, they are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, if only 20% of all students choose contemporary dance and 25% of the remainder choose jazz dance, then the probability of selecting someone for hip-hop would be equal to [the complement of choosing contemporary OR jazz] x [remainder]. Using mathematical expressions, the following can be written. Complement of choosing contemporary dance: (100% - 20%)
Complement of choosing contemporary AND jazz dance: 100% minus the product of individual probabilities (which is not necessary in this case because they don't share any students). The formula will look like this:
(100% - [probability of contemporary] - [probability of jazz]) x [percentage of remaining students]. So, the probability of choosing someone for hip-hop becomes:
((100% - 20%) - 25%) x 40%
= 70% x 40%
= 28%

Now, to get the actual number of students who chose hip hop, multiply 28% with the total number of students, which is 20. This gives us an answer of approximately 5.6 students who enrolled in hip hop dance, but rounded up to the nearest integer gives us 6. Answer: Approximately 6 (rounded up) % of the total students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

However, some assumptions were made when calculating the above values. One major assumption was that each category of dance is independent of others, meaning that a person cannot enroll in more than one type of dance simultaneously. It is possible that some students might have joined multiple classes, and thus, this method may yield less accurate results.

In practice, it would require further information regarding how many students took multiple classes, or whether there were separate lists provided for every dance form. Without such data available, however, using the method described previously would give approximate answers based solely on what has already been presented.

Therefore, while using the percentage approach, always bear in mind its limitations and assumptions. Try to verify your solution whenever possible.",0
GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,Zero-shot-CoT,"  Great! To find out what percentage of the entire group enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to use our knowledge of proportions. Here are the given percentages:

* 20% of the dancers enrolled in contemporary dance (which means that 80% of the dancers did not enroll in contemporary dance)
* 25% of the remaining dancers (i.e., those who did not enroll in contemporary dance) enrolled in jazz dance (which means that 75% of the remaining dancers did not enroll in jazz dance)
* The remaining dancers (i.e., those who did not enroll in either contemporary or jazz dance) enrolled in hip-hop dance (which means that 100% - 20% - 25% = 55% of the dancers enrolled in hip-hop dance).

So, if there were 20 students in total, then:

55% of 20 students = 11 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.",0

GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"1. Understand the Problem:
James is running three sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week. We need to find out how many total meters he's running per week. 

2. Extract Relevant Variables & Numerals:
- Number of sprints: 3 (per day) x 3 (days in a week) = 9 sprints/week
- Distance for one sprint: 60 meters

3. Devise Plan:
Calculate the total distance James covers every time he runs all nine sprints in a week. Then, multiply this value with the number of weeks he runs this way for an entire year. This will tell us his total annual mileage.

4. Calculate Intermediate Results:
First, we'll figure out how far James runs during one session or ""workout"" (three sprints). A single workout is made up of three sprints that are 60m long. So, James runs 60*3=180m during a single workout. 
Next, since James works out three times a week, he completes 9 workouts in seven days, which means he runs 9 * 180m = 1620 m (rounded off to two decimal places) per week.

5. Solve the Problem Step By Step:
To determine James' annual distance traveled, we would take our weekly result from above and then multiple it by the number of weeks in a year (52):

1620 m per week × 52 weeks per year = 84,976,000 m per year (rounded off to four decimal places)

So, if James continues to follow his current regimen, he could cover over 84 million meters (or about 52,719 miles!) annually while training at his current pace! But remember, the numbers might be larger than those given as inputs in real life problems because they have been rounded off.

Note: In general, you can use the formula Total_Distance = No_Sprints_Per_Workout * Length_Of_Each_Sprint * No_Workouts_In_Week * Weeks_Trained_During_Year to calculate the total distance covered by someone who trains regularly.",0

We can do this by multiplying the length and width of each room.

The length of each room is 19 feet, and the width is 18 feet, so the area of each room is:

Area = Length x Width = 19 ft x 18 ft = 342 sq ft

SingleEq,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe wants 8 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups. How many more cups does she need to add?,Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! Let's break down the problem step by step:

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe wants 8 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups. How many more cups does she need to add?

Variables involved:

* Number of cups of flour needed = 8 cups
* Amount of flour already added = 2 cups

Plan:

1. Subtract the amount of flour already added from the total number of cups needed to find out how many more cups are required.
2. Convert the quantity of flour from cups to a numerical value for easier calculations.
3. Calculate the difference between the total number of cups needed and the amount of flour already added.
4. Divide the result from step 3 by the conversion factor (1 cup = 0.25 gallons) to get the final answer in gallons.

Now, let's follow our plan and solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Subtract the amount of flour already added from the total number of cups needed.
Number of cups needed - Amount of flour already added = 8 cups - 2 cups = 6 cups

Step 2: Convert the quantity of flour from cups to a numerical value.
1 cup = 0.25 gallons
So, 6 cups = 6 x 0.25 = 1.5 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of cups needed and the amount of flour already added.
Total number of cups needed - Amount of flour already added = 8 cups - 2 cups = 6 cups

Step 4: Divide the result from step 3 by the conversion factor to get the final answer in gallons.
6 cups / 0.25 gallons per cup = 24 gallons

Therefore, Mary needs to add 24 gallons of flour to the remaining 6 cups to make the entire 8 cups of flour called for in the recipe.",0

Mom bought a total of 70 white T-shirts, which she divided into 14 packages. That means the total number of white T-shirts in all 14 packages is 70. Using the formula for finding the total sum (in this case, it would be to find the total number of shirts), we can write an equation with variables:
Total # of Shirts = Number of Packages * # of Shirts Per Package
So, let's substitute our known values:
Total # of Shirts = 14 * x (where 'x' represents the number of shirts per package)
But we already know the total number of shirts - there are 70 in total! We just need to isolate 'x'. This means solving for 'x', using inverse operations such as division or multiplication. To do so, divide both sides by 14 (the number of packages):
Total # of Shirts / 14 = (Number of Packages)(# of Shirts Per Package)/14
Or:
Total # of Shirts / Total # of Packages = Average # of Shirts Per Package
Solving for 'x':
(Total # of Shirts/Total # of Packages) * Total # of Packages = Total # of Shirts
And since we want to solve for 'x', we replace 'Total # of Shirts' on the right side of the original equation with its equivalent value:
(Number of Packages*# of Shirts Per Package) / Number of Packages = # of Shirts Per Package
Simplifying the above expression, we get:
# of Shirts Per Package = Total # of Shirts / Number of Packages
Substituting our given values:
# of Shirts Per Package = 70 / 14

During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Variables and Numerical Values:
- Average Wage for Fortnight = $90 per day
- Average Wage for First Seven Days = $87 per day
- Average Wage for Last Seven Days = $92 per day

To find the wage on the 8th Day:
We know that the total earnings in 15 consecutive working days is given as: 
Total Earnings = ($90 x 15)
But we also have another piece of information which tells us that the total earning from the first seven days were $609 (calculated using Total Earning from First Seven Days = ($87 x 7))
This means that the remaining earnings would be calculated as:
Remaining Earnings = Total Earnings - Total Earnings From First Seven Days
Substituting the values, we get:
Remaining Earnings = ($90 x 15) - ($609)

Now, since there are still 8 more working days left after the end of the seventh day, the remaining earnings need to be divided among those eight days. Thus, we can say that each of these days will earn an amount equal to this remaining earnings divided by 8, i.e., Remaining Earnings / Number of Working Days Left.
So, the wage for the 8th day is given as:
Wage for 8th Day = Remaining Earnings / Number of Working Days Left
Substituting the values, we get:
Wage for 8th Day = [($90 x 15) - ($609)]/8
Simplifying further:
Wage for 8th Day = [$90 * 15] + (-$609)/8
Calculate Intermediate Results:
[The negative sign before $609 indicates subtraction.]
[The division with remainder option has been used here so that the value of quotient is displayed along with any possible remainders.]
(-$609)÷ 8 = $-76.125 (remainder is zero)
Therefore, Wage for 8th Day = [$90 * 15] + (-$609)/8
= ($90 * 15) + (-$609) / 8
= $1,350 - $76.125
= $1,273.875
Rounded off to two decimal places, the final result is:
Wage for 8th Day = $1,273.88

Answer according to choices provided in question:
(C) $90

Since our calculations revealed that the wage earned on the 8th day should be $1,273.88, it's clear that choice C does not match the actual wage earned on the 8th day. Therefore, Choice C cannot be the answer.

Hence, the answer is (E): $1,040.

Explanation:
From the available choices, only one number seems plausible because it appears between the other numbers given above. That is why we choose $1,040. This represents the average earnings per day over the entire fortnight, or $1,040 divided by 15, which gives us $69.33 per day. If we assume that the wage on the 8th day was less than what is being offered by all other choices, then we might expect to see the same pattern throughout the rest of the workdays in terms of decreasing income. However, based on our earlier calculations, we found that the wage earned on the 8th day was actually higher than what most people think due to the way they interpreted the data. In fact, the highest wage earned during the fortnight was on the very next day, specifically, the 9th day. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information about the exact timing and duration of each shift worked by the employee to pinpoint exactly when and where the highest wage occurred. Nonetheless, it's safe to conclude that choosing an answer anywhere within the range suggested by the multiple choice options is highly unlikely considering how precise the original data was. Moreover, since the answer presented itself as an isolated figure rather than part of a larger trend, we can safely eliminate all possibilities except for one. With this in mind, it becomes easier to narrow down the correct answer from the given set of alternatives.

In conclusion, the right answer would be (E) $1,040, but if you want to double-check your math, you can compare this answer against the intermediate results mentioned in my previous response. As long as both answers agree, then you",0

During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Let X be the unknown wage for the 8th day.
The total earnings in the first 7 days are given as follows:
Total earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 87 = $609
Similarly, we can calculate the total earnings over the last 7 days:
Last Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 92 = $644
Now, let's calculate the total earnings for all 15 days to get the grand total:
Grand Total = First Total Earnings + Last Total Earnings - Total Earnings on Day 8
= $609 + $644 - x
(Note that this is because if we add both the first and last total earnings, we will have counted the earnings from the overlapping period twice.)
Since the total earnings for the 15-day period were fixed at $90 per day multiplied by 15 days, which means $1,350, our equation becomes:
$1,350 = $609 + $644 - x
Subtracting $609 from each side yields:
$741 = $644 - x
Adding x to both sides gives us:
x + $741 = $644
To find out what x equals, subtract $741 from both sides:
x = $-741
However, since negative values aren't possible here, there must have been an error or misunderstanding somewhere.
If we assume that the question meant ""during"" instead of ""comprising,"" then it would make more sense. In other words, the sum of the wages during the first 7 days, plus the sum of the wages during the last 7 days, should equal the total amount earned during those 15 days ($1,350). Based on that understanding, here's how you could solve the problem:
First Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 87 = $609
Last Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 92 = $644
Finally, we set up an equation:
First Total Earning + Last Total Earning = Grand Total
= $609 + $644 - x

To calculate the wage on the 8th day, we can find out how much he earned in total up until that point by adding the earnings from the previous two weeks to what he earned on the 8th day. So let's call this variable ""total_earnings"" at the end of the second week plus the earnings on the 8th day which we will label as ""day_eight"". This gives us:
total_earnings = $1253 - $644 + $x   // where $x is our unknown earning for day eight
    total_earnings = $609 + $x  

We know that if we divide the total earnings by the number of days worked so far (which includes day eight), we get an average daily wage. Since we have already calculated the averages for each week, let's use those here instead of calculating them again. Therefore, since there were fourteen days (first seven plus eighth plus last seven) leading up to this calculation, the formula becomes:
$609 / 14 = $43.50    // Average Daily Wage before Day Eight (for Week One only).
$644 / 14 = $45.93     // Average Daily Wage before Day Eight (for Week Two only).

But we want to calculate the overall AVERAGE DAILY WAGE UP TO DAY EIGHT. That means we need to include all earnings made up until then. We add the daily wage on day eight (let's call it $y) with the weighted averages before day eight. Weighting refers to giving more importance or value to certain data points based on their significance or relevance. In this case, the longer period has more influence than the shorter one. Let's create another equation using the same methodology but now taking into account all the days between the beginning and ending of the time frame we're considering. To do this, we multiply the earnings on Day Eight (which we don't yet know) times its fraction of days within that timeframe, and sum that product along with similar products from the other periods. Here's the formula:
(($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)) / ((7+1)+6) = $45.24      // First term represents the total amount earned in the first week; Second term represents the total amount earned in the second week; Denominator represents the total number of days considered (including day eight). By setting up this ratio, you could see that this is just the average income up through the end of the second week, because it takes into consideration every single penny earned during that span of time (with weights that vary depending on the length of time). Now comes the fun part! Substitute these values back into our original formula for the average daily wage up to day eight:
((($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6) + $y) / ((7+1)+6) = $x   // Using y to represent the unkown day-eight income. But we also have:
(($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6) + $90 * 1) / ((7+1)+6) = $45.33     // Total income up to the end of the second week (when no further calculations are done.) Solving for Y, we get:
Y = $45.33 - [($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)] / ((7+1)+6)   // Plugging the known numbers into the above formula. Simplifying yields:
Y = $45.33 - $[($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)] / 27   // Numerator represents the total income earned up until the end of week 2; Divisor represents the total number of days up until the end of week 2.

We are given that the total number of working days in the fortnight is 15.
The average wage for the entire fortnight is $90 per day.
The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day, and the average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day.

Let's denote the wage earned on the 8th day as x. We can use this information to create an equation:

x + ($87 \* 6) / 7 = $90

Solving for x:

$87 \* 6 = $462

$462 / 7 = $65.86

Subtracting $65.86 from $90 gives us:

$24.14 - $65.86 = -$41.72

This result doesn't make sense because it indicates that the worker earned less than nothing on the 8th day. Therefore, we made an error somewhere. 

Let's reconsider our approach. Instead of using the average wage for the entire fortnight, we should use the weighted average wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days separately. This will give us more accurate information about the worker's earnings on each day.

Weighted Average Wage for First 7 Days:

($87 \* 7) / 7 = $561

Weighted Average Wage for Last 7 Days:

($92 \* 7) / 7 = $644

Total Earnings for Fortnight:

$561 + $644 = $1205

Now, we know that the total earnings for the fortnight were $1205. To find out how much the worker earned on the 8th day, we need to subtract the total earnings for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total earnings for the fortnight:

$1205 - ($561 + $644) = $100

Therefore, the worker earned $100 on the 8th day.",0

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, we need to find out how many total apples were ordered by the school: 42 red + 7 green = 50 apples.
2. Next, we know that only 9 students want fruit, so the school needs to prepare enough apples for those 9 students.
3. To do this, they would divide the number of apples needed (for the 9 students) by the average size of an apple (which is assumed to be about 6 oz): 9 / 6 = 1.5 apples per student.
4. Since each student gets one apple, there are still 8 more apples left over (9 - 1 = 8).
5. However, since these remaining apples are not part of the original order, but rather leftovers from previous days or possibly damaged fruits, it's reasonable to assume that none of them can be used again.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students' lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?

To solve this problem, we need to use our critical thinking skills and follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem: We know that the cafeteria ordered a total of 50 apples (42 red + 7 green). We also know that only 9 students wanted fruit.
2. Extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals:
	* Number of apples ordered = 50
	* Number of students who wanted fruit = 9
3. Devise a plan: To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples requested by students from the total number of apples ordered.
4. Carry out the plan:
	* Total number of apples ordered - Number of apples requested by students = Extra apples
	So, 50 - 9 = 41
5. Calculate intermediate results: If there were 41 extra apples, then the number of red apples left over would be:
	* 42 - 9 = 33 red apples left over
	* And the number of green apples left over would be:
	* 7 - 9 = -2 green apples left over (since negative numbers indicate an excess)
6. Solve the problem step by step: Now, we can see that the cafeteria ended up with 41 extra apples. Since they had 33 red apples left over and -2 green apples left over, the final count of apples is:
	* Red apples = 33
	* Green apples = -2
7. Show the answer: Finally, here are the answers to the question:
	* How many extra apples did the cafeteria end up with? = 41
	* How many red apples were left over? = 33
	* How many green apples were left over? = -2

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 41 extra apples, 33 red apples were left over, and -2 green apples were left over.",0

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of students who wanted fruit from the total number of apples ordered.

MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Let's calculate the total number of apples (red + green) that were originally ordered:
42 red apples + 7 green apples = 49 total apples

Now let's calculate the total number of apples consumed by the 9 students who wanted fruit:
Each student received one apple (either red or green), so we can multiply the number of students by the average number of apples per student:
(Number of students)(Apples per student) = Total Apples Consumed
(9)(1) = 9 total apples consumed

The difference between the original order and the total consumed gives us the number of excess apples left over:
Total Number Ordered - Total Number Consumed = Excess Amount Left Over
49 - 9 = 40 excess apples left over

So the cafeteria ended up with an excess of 40 apples. This means they have to find other ways to use them before they go bad!",1
MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's assign some variable names to make it easier to follow along:
- r = number of red apples ordered
- g = number of green apples ordered
- n = number of students who want fruit
- x = number of extra apples left over

We know that:
r + g = total number of apples ordered (which is given)

So we have:
42 + 7 = 49 (total number of apples ordered)

Also, since there are fewer than half as many green apples compared to red ones, we can say that:
g < r/2

This means that there will be more leftover red apples than green apples (because they have more in stock). Therefore, we can assume that most likely all the green apples were eaten or distributed among the students who chose them. However, this does not necessarily mean that all the red apples were taken either because maybe more students took red apples than just those who asked for fruit.

To find out exactly what happened, we need to see how many apples each student got on average using the formula:
(total number of fruits shared)/(number of students)

In our case:
(red apples + green apples) / (students choosing fruit)
= (42 * 0.5 + 7) / 9  # assuming that every student who chose fruit got at least one apple (since both types of apples were available)
≈ 8.66 apples per student

Since each student received an integer amount of apples (either whole or halved), we round down when calculating the exact number of apples consumed by the students who selected fruit. This means that less than 1 full apple was consumed in total.

Now, let's do some calculations based on the above information. We know that:
n * avg_apples_per_student = total number of apples eaten

Therefore:
9 * 8 = 72 (total number of apples eaten by those who chose fruit)

The remaining apples would be:
49 - 72 = 23 (the total number of unused and uneaten apples)

Of these 23 apples, the vast majority will be from the red category, so let's assume that almost all of them belong to the group of ""extra"" red apples. Based on this assumption:
x ≈ 23 (we don't know the exact value of x yet, but we estimate it should be close to 23)

But wait! What if some of the red apples were also used by other students (maybe they had seconds or chose to take two instead of one)? In order to account for this possibility, let's subtract any potential red apples already eaten by non-fruit eaters:

If we assume that about 5% of the students who didn't choose fruit still ended up eating red apples (even though they weren't supposed to), then approximately:
0.05 * 36 (total number of students not selecting fruit) * 0.5 (each student gets at least one apple) * 2 (some students may have chosen two) = 1.2 apples (potential apples wasted due to error or double servings)

These wasted red apples could potentially be considered part of the excess inventory, but we won't add them unless we have concrete evidence that they were indeed lost or thrown away. Since we cannot confirm whether these wasted apples actually occurred, we will exclude them for now. This gives us:
x = 23 - 1.2 (estimated number of unused and uneaten red apples)

Finally, let's revise our original estimation for the exact number of unused and uneaten apples based on the calculated result above:
x ≈ 21.8 apples (rounded down to the nearest integer)

It seems like quite a few red apples went to waste, which could be a concern for the school's budget and sustainability efforts. It might be worthwhile for the school to investigate why so many red apples remain unconsumed and to consider alternative options such as distributing smaller portions, reducing portion sizes overall, or offering a wider variety of fruits.",0

AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Plan of action:
1. Identify the initial number of roses in the vase: 6
2. Find the difference between the final and initial numbers of roses: Final - Initial = Difference
3. Calculate the final number of roses using subtraction: Total Roses (Final) - Total Roses (Initial) = Number Of Roses Added/Cut
4. Subtract the original number of roses in the vase from the total number of roses to find how many more roses have been added or taken away.
5. Solve for ""Number Of Roses Cut"" by finding the difference between the total roses before adding new ones and the total roses after cutting.

Solution:
Let's say Mary added x roses to the vase when she brought them over. The total number of roses in the vase is equal to the sum of the original number of roses plus the number of additional roses that Mary brought. So, we can write an equation:

Total Roses (New) = Original Roses + Additional Roses
                           = 6 + x

Now, given that there are 16 roses in the vase after Mary has finished cutting and adding roses, we can set up another equation using this information as well. We know that the total number of roses after Mary has done both tasks should be equal to the total number of roses before Mary started doing anything minus the number of roses that Mary cut off AND PLUS THE NUMBER OF ROSES THAT MARY ADDED TO THE VASE. Thus, our second equation would look like:

Total Roses (After Adding And Removing Roses) = Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses) – Number Of Roses That Mary Cut Off + Number Of Roses That Mary Added To The Vase
                                               = 6 – Number Of Roses Cut Off + x

Finally, since these two equations represent the same situation, they must be equivalent. Therefore, setting the left-hand sides of each equation equal will result in:

Original Roses + Additional Roses = Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses) – Number Of Roses That Mary Cut Off + x

Substituting the right side of the above formula with the expression for ""Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses)"" which was derived in Equation #1:

6 + x = 6 – Number Of Roses Cut Off + x

Simplifying, we get:

x = Number Of Roses Cut Off

Therefore, if Mary had originally 6 roses in the vase and then she cuts off n roses, it means that she takes n roses from 6 roses initially available. After she does that, she adds x more roses to the vase. Since we know that the end result shows 16 roses in the vase, the number of roses cut off can be calculated as follows:

Number Of Roses Cut Off = Total Roses Before (6) – Total Roses After (16) + X (total number of roses she added)
        	= 6 – 16 + x
        	= -10 + x

However, because the number of roses cannot be negative, we need to adjust this solution. When we add x roses and take n roses away, we actually ADD (-n) roses to account for the fact that we took n roses AWAY. In other words, what we really want to do is to ADD (-N) roses instead of taking them away so that we don't create a negative value. This modification allows us to use simple addition to find the number of roses that Mary added while accounting for the number of roses that Mary removed. Hence, the modified equation looks like:

Number Of Roses Cut Off = Total Roses Before (6) – Total Roses After (16) + X (total number of roses she added) – (-N) (number of roses she cut off)
            	= 6 – 16 + x - (-N)
            	= -10 + x + N

Using this adjusted equation, we can conclude that:

If Mary had 6 roses in the vase at first, but later on, she added x roses and cut off n roses, then:

The number of roses that Mary cut off is: N = -(10 + x)

In this particular case, we already know that x is positive because we were told that Mary added some roses (i.e., x > 0). Also, we know that N needs to",0

Original number + Number of flowers added = Total number of flowers
(6) + (x) = (16)

Subtracting the initial number from both sides:

Number of flowers added = Total number - Original number
x = (16) - (6)

Simplifying:

x = (10)

So Mary cut 10 roses.",1
AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The initial number of roses in the vase is 6. After cutting some roses, there are now 16 roses in the vase. We need to find out how many roses Mary cut.

Let's denote the number of roses that Mary cut as x. 

We can set up an equation based on this information:

Initial Number of Roses + Cut Roses = Final Number of Roses

6 + x = 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 16 - 6

x = 10

Therefore, Mary cut 10 roses from her flower garden.",1

CSQA,What is a place that has a bench nestled in trees? Answer Choices: (A) state park (B) bus stop (C) bus depot (D) statue (E) train station,Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! I'm happy to help you with this question. To find the correct answer, we can break down the information provided into smaller parts:

* ""a bench"" - This tells us there is a bench involved in the scenario.
* ""nestled in trees"" - This gives us an idea of the environment where the bench is located. It suggests that the bench is surrounded or partially hidden by trees.

Now, based on these clues, let's consider each possible answer choice:

(A) State Park - A state park could potentially have a bench nestled among trees, but it might not be the most likely option since the wording of the question implies a more secluded or natural setting.

(B) Bus Stop - A bus stop may have a bench nearby, but it's unlikely to be nestled in trees. Benches at bus stops are usually placed along sidewalks or roadsides.

(C) Bus Depot - Similar to a bus stop, a bus depot would typically have benches near the entrance or waiting area, rather than nestled in trees.

(D) Statue - While a statue could have a bench nearby, it's unlikely to be nestled in trees like the one described in the question.

(E) Train Station - Like a bus depot, a train station may have benches near the platform or waiting area, but again, they wouldn't typically be nestled in trees.

CSQA,Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Answer Choices: (A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school,Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,PS+,"  Great! You're ready to solve this problem. Here are the options for where it might be a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher:

(A) School Bus - It is not required to have a fire extinguisher on a school bus because they are designed with safety features such as fire-resistant materials, emergency exit windows, and smoke detectors that alert passengers in case of a fire. Additionally, most school buses are equipped with a fire suppression system that can automatically put out fires before they spread.

(B) Boat - While having a fire extinguisher on a boat may seem like a good idea, it is actually not required by law in many jurisdictions. This is because boats are typically made of flammable materials and are located near water, which can make it difficult to fight a fire effectively. However, it is still recommended to have a fire extinguisher on board in case of an emergency.

(C) House - Having a fire extinguisher in your home is highly recommended, but it is not always required by law. Some states or localities may have specific regulations regarding the installation and maintenance of fire extinguishers in residential areas. However, it is important to note that having a fire extinguisher in your home can help save lives and property in case of a fire emergency.

(D) Hospital - In a hospital setting, fire extinguishers are usually provided for patient safety and to comply with regulatory requirements. Hospitals are considered high-risk facilities due to the presence of flammable materials, electrical equipment, and potential ignition sources. Therefore, having a fire extinguisher in a hospital is both a good idea and a legal requirement.

(E) School - As you mentioned earlier, schools are also considered high-risk facilities due to the presence of children, flammable materials, and potential ignition sources. Therefore, having a fire extinguisher in a school is both a good idea and a legal requirement in many jurisdictions.

So, the correct answer is (E) School.",0

CSQA,Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Answer Choices: (A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school,Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,Zero-shot-CoT,"  Great! A fire extinguisher can be useful in various locations, but it may not always be necessary or required in every situation. Here are the answer choices for where a fire extinguisher might not be needed or required:

(D) Hospital - Hospitals typically have advanced fire safety systems and equipment, including automatic sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and emergency response plans. Fire extinguishers may not be as critical in hospitals due to these measures.

(E) School - While schools should have fire safety protocols in place, they often have limited space and resources compared to other buildings. As such, fire extinguishers may not be deemed essential in all schools. However, this varies depending on local regulations and building codes.

The remaining options are incorrect because they do require fire extinguishers:

(A) School Bus - School buses are subject to strict safety regulations, which include having a fire extinguisher on board. This is crucial for protecting students during emergencies while traveling.

(B) Boat - Boats, especially larger ones, need fire extinguishers to combat fires that could occur from fuel leaks, electrical malfunctions, or other sources. Being out at sea without an effective means of fighting fires poses significant risks.

(C) House - Homes also benefit from having fire extinguishers nearby, particularly in areas with high fire risk, like those near forests or close to cooking appliances. Having one in your home can help you respond quickly if a small fire breaks out.",0
CSQA,Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Answer Choices: (A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"In terms of safety, it can be argued that having a fire extinguisher on board boats and in hospitals could potentially save lives or prevent significant damage from fires. However, schools are typically equipped with sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and other emergency measures to address potential fires. Additionally, most schools do not allow open flames or cooking appliances within classrooms, reducing the risk of fires. Therefore, while having a fire extinguisher at a school would still be an excellent idea for certain situations, it is not as crucial as in boats or hospitals due to other safety protocols already being in place. The answer is E, school.",0
CSQA,Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Answer Choices: (A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"To answer this question based on given choices, it's necessary to know that having a fire extinguisher on board boats or ships is highly recommended for emergency situations in case of small fires. However, it's also mandatory to have a fire suppression system installed on larger vessels as per International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards. So, while having a fire extinguisher on a boat isn't necessarily legally mandated, it would be considered a good idea due to safety reasons. In contrast, schools are already legally required to have fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and properly functioning fire extinguishers under various state and local codes. Hospitals and houses don't fall into any legal requirement either because they usually meet strict building codes, including requirements regarding smoke detectors, fire alarm systems, and other life-safety equipment. Therefore, having a fire extinguisher in those places can still be beneficial, but there aren't specific laws requiring them. Based on these considerations, although having a fire extinguisher is an excellent idea in most settings, answering ""school"" might be misleading since it implies that no law requires schools to have one - which contradicts the fact that many states and cities require fire safety measures in educational facilities. The correct answer should be option B, i.e., boat.

In short, the answer to the original question is B - Boat.",0
