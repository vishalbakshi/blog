0,AQuA,"The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"The total earnings for the first seven days are: ($87 x 7 = ) $609
The total earnings for the last seven days are: ($92 x 7 = ) $644
Therefore, the total earnings over both weeks (fortnights) would be: ($609 + $644 = ) $1253
To calculate the wage on the 8th day, we can find out how much he earned in total up until that point by adding the earnings from the previous two weeks to what he earned on the 8th day. So let's call this variable ""total_earnings"" at the end of the second week plus the earnings on the 8th day which we will label as ""day_eight"". This gives us:
total_earnings = $1253 - $644 + $x   // where $x is our unknown earning for day eight
    total_earnings = $609 + $x  

We know that if we divide the total earnings by the number of days worked so far (which includes day eight), we get an average daily wage. Since we have already calculated the averages for each week, let's use those here instead of calculating them again. Therefore, since there were fourteen days (first seven plus eighth plus last seven) leading up to this calculation, the formula becomes:
$609 / 14 = $43.50    // Average Daily Wage before Day Eight (for Week One only).
$644 / 14 = $45.93     // Average Daily Wage before Day Eight (for Week Two only).

But we want to calculate the overall AVERAGE DAILY WAGE UP TO DAY EIGHT. That means we need to include all earnings made up until then. We add the daily wage on day eight (let's call it $y) with the weighted averages before day eight. Weighting refers to giving more importance or value to certain data points based on their significance or relevance. In this case, the longer period has more influence than the shorter one. Let's create another equation using the same methodology but now taking into account all the days between the beginning and ending of the time frame we're considering. To do this, we multiply the earnings on Day Eight (which we don't yet know) times its fraction of days within that timeframe, and sum that product along with similar products from the other periods. Here's the formula:
(($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)) / ((7+1)+6) = $45.24      // First term represents the total amount earned in the first week; Second term represents the total amount earned in the second week; Denominator represents the total number of days considered (including day eight). By setting up this ratio, you could see that this is just the average income up through the end of the second week, because it takes into consideration every single penny earned during that span of time (with weights that vary depending on the length of time). Now comes the fun part! Substitute these values back into our original formula for the average daily wage up to day eight:
((($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6) + $y) / ((7+1)+6) = $x   // Using y to represent the unkown day-eight income. But we also have:
(($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6) + $90 * 1) / ((7+1)+6) = $45.33     // Total income up to the end of the second week (when no further calculations are done.) Solving for Y, we get:
Y = $45.33 - [($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)] / ((7+1)+6)   // Plugging the known numbers into the above formula. Simplifying yields:
Y = $45.33 - $[($43.50 * 7) + ($45.93 * 6)] / 27   // Numerator represents the total income earned up until the end of week 2; Divisor represents the total number of days up until the end of week 2. If we solve for 'Y', we should arrive at the earnings for the 8th day. After some algebraic manipulation, we obtain:
Y = (27*$45.33 - ($43.50 * 7 * 6) - ($45"
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"(A) AB/2700 

Explanation: Let's say the price per bottle for both scenarios is x. In scenario 1 (given), we have:
   - Total cost = $27 * x (since there are 27 bottles)
   - Therefore, x can be found by dividing the total cost ($27) by the number of bottles (27):
      x = $27 / 27 = $1 per bottle

In scenario 2, let's assume that B bottles costs y. We want to find out what value of y would result in a total cost of $x * B when each bottle costs $x. By setting up a proportion and solving it using cross-multiplication, we get:
   
   $y$/$x$ = $B$$b$/$A$
   --- Cross Multiply ---
   $y$*$A$ = $B$$x$
   $y$ = $(B$$x$) / $A$
   $y$ = ($B$ * $1$) / $A$
   $y$ = ($B$ / $A$) * $1$ (per bottle)

Since the question asked about ""cost in dollars"", we need to convert this final answer from ""$"" per bottle to ""$"" for all B bottles. So, multiplying by B gives us:
   $y$ = ($B$ / $A$) * $1$ per bottle * $B$ total bottles
   $y$ = ($B^2$ / $A$) dollars for all B bottles

Therefore, the formula to calculate the cost per bottle (in ""$"") is:
   Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($Cost To Buy X Number Of Bottles (Total Dollars Spent)/Number Of Bottles Purchased)

We can rearrange this formula to solve for y (the total cost if we buy B bottles). Here's where our original calculation comes in handy. Since we already know that one bottle costs $1$, plugging in these values into the previous formula yields:
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = $B$ * $1$ (per bottle) * $B$ total bottles
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = $B^2$ dollars

Now, using the information given in the question, we can substitute this formula with variables instead of numbers:
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = AB^2 / A^2 * $2700 (from Scenario 1)
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = AB / 2700 * $2700
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($AB$) / 2700 dollars

Finally, to make sure we answered the correct question, we need to divide the total cost for buying all B bottles by the number of bottles bought (which is B). This gives us the average or mean cost per bottle. But since they ask for the cost in dollars, not just the cost per bottle, we don't take the last step. Instead, we simply return the calculated value as the final answer.

The formula for calculating the cost per bottle if you purchase B bottles at a price of $X per bottle is:
   Average Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($B^2$ * $X$) / ($A^2$ * $2700$)

So, returning back to our problem:

Let's use the provided values:
- X = $1$ (price per bottle in Scenario 1)
- A = 27 (number of bottles purchased in Scenario 1)
- B =? (variable representing number of bottles being considered now)

Substituting those known values above into the previously derived formula gives us:

   Average Cost Per Bottle (in ""$"") = ($B^2$ * $1$) / ($27^2$ * $2700$)

But this isn't quite what was requested; we wanted the total cost for purchasing B bottles. Fortunately, we only need to modify the numerator slightly to achieve this goal!
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($B$ * $1$) / ($A$ * $2700$)
   Total Cost For Buying All B Bottles (in ""$"") = ($B$ / $A$) * $2700$ / 1 dollar per bottle (Scenario 1)"
2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). In one week (7 days), he would do this 9 times (3 sets x 3 days) for a total distance of 1800 meters (or 1.8 kilometers):

(Number of Sprints per Session * Distance per Sprint) * (Number of Sets per Week * Number of Days per Set) = Total Meters Run in One Week
(3 * 60) * (3 * 3) = 1800 (meters) or 1800000 (millimeters)"
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Let's calculate this using math:

Firstly, let's find out how many students are left after selecting those who took contemporary dance (since they were excluded from further options):
   - Total number of students = 20
   - Number of students who took contemporary dance = 4 (i.e., 20% of total)
   - Remaining students = Total number of students - Students who took contemporary dance = 16

Next, let's calculate the number of students who selected Jazz Dance among the remaining students:
    - Number of students who remained = 16
    - Percentage of students who took Jazz Dance = 25%
    - Number of students who took Jazz Dance = 16 * 0.25 = 4

Finally, let's subtract the number of students who took Jazz Dance from the remaining students to find out how many students enrolled in Hip Hop Dance:
    - Number of students who remained = 16
    - Number of students who took Jazz Dance = 4
    - Number of students who took Hip Hop Dance (the remainder) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now we have all necessary data to figure out what percentage of the entire group has taken up hip hop as their dance style.
    - Total number of students = 20
    - Number of students who took Hip Hop Dance = 12
    - Percentage of students who took Hip Hop Dance = 12 / 20 x 100% = 60%

So, 60% or two thirds of the overall student population chose hip hop dance."
4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Let's calculate the total number of apples (red + green) that were originally ordered:
42 red apples + 7 green apples = 49 total apples

Now let's calculate the total number of apples consumed by the 9 students who wanted fruit:
Each student received one apple (either red or green), so we can multiply the number of students by the average number of apples per student:
(Number of students)(Apples per student) = Total Apples Consumed
(9)(1) = 9 total apples consumed

The difference between the original order and the total consumed gives us the number of excess apples left over:
Total Number Ordered - Total Number Consumed = Excess Amount Left Over
49 - 9 = 40 excess apples left over

So the cafeteria ended up with an excess of 40 apples. This means they have to find other ways to use them before they go bad!"
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Firstly, let's find out how many total carrots Carol and her mother picked (good + bad). Total = Carol's pick + Mom's Pick - Number of Good Carrots (as we want to subtract them)
Total = 29 + 16 - 38
Total = 17
The number of bad carrots will be equal to the difference between the Total and the Number of Good Carrots. In this case, that would be 17 - 38 (-ve sign indicates subtraction) = -21 (-ve sign indicates negative result)
However, it cannot be a negative quantity since there can't be negative carrots! Hence, there must be an error in the given information as if both Carol and her mother picked only good carrots, then the number of bad carrots should be zero. Therefore, either some details are missing or there may be a mistake somewhere else in the question/answer. Please provide further clarification on what was meant by ""only 38 of the carrots were good."" Were these two people responsible for all those carrots being grown, or are other factors involved? Is there any more information available about why so few of the harvested carrots were considered ""good""?"

However, this calculation assumes that there is no overlap between adjacent rooms' floor areas. In reality, some carpeting may be necessary at doorways or around room edges, so it's essential to measure each room accurately and allow extra space for transitions.

9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Mary cut (total number of roses - initial number of roses) = 16 - 6 = 10 roses.

The number of roses that Mary cut can be found by subtracting the original number of roses, which was 6, from the total number of roses after cutting them, which was 16. This gives us a difference of 10 roses that Mary must have added to the vase. So, Mary cut 10 more roses and put them into the vase with the original six roses. Therefore, there are now 16 roses in the vase altogether."
10,SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot,"Let's assume that there were three items on the menu with prices $x$, $y$, and $z$. Since they split it equally, each person had to pay for one-third of the total cost of those three dishes. Therefore, we can set up a system of equations as follows:

1st Person (Sally) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$
2nd Person (Sam) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$
3rd Person (Alyssa) pays $x/3 + y/3 + z/3$

Adding all these payments together gives us the total price of their meal.

Total Price = $x/3 + x/3 + x/3 + y/3 + y/3 + y/3 + z/3 + z/3$
= $(x+y+z)/3 * 3$
= ($x+y+z$)

Now, let's use this formula in our problem statement. Each person paid $45$ so we can find out how much money they spent on those three items by dividing $45$ by $3$:

Each person paid $(1/3)*(total\ cost)$
So if Sally, Sam, and Alyssa each paid $45$, then:

$(1/3)*(total\ cost) = 45$
Multiplying both sides by $3$:

$(total\ cost) = 3*45$

Therefore, the total cost of their meal would be $135$ which means that the three items cost $135$ when split between them. We don't know exactly how much each item costs, but we do know that they added up to $135$.

Note that you could also solve for the individual costs using algebraic methods. However, this method may not always provide an exact solution depending on your input data. For example, if two people ordered the same dish but one got dessert while the other didn't, finding out the exact cost per person becomes more difficult. In such cases, you might need additional information or assumptions to proceed further."

0,AQuA,"The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Let X be the unknown wage for the 8th day.
The total earnings in the first 7 days are given as follows:
Total earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 87 = $609
Similarly, we can calculate the total earnings over the last 7 days:
Last Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 92 = $644
Now, let's calculate the total earnings for all 15 days to get the grand total:
Grand Total = First Total Earnings + Last Total Earnings - Total Earnings on Day 8
= $609 + $644 - x
(Note that this is because if we add both the first and last total earnings, we will have counted the earnings from the overlapping period twice.)
Since the total earnings for the 15-day period were fixed at $90 per day multiplied by 15 days, which means $1,350, our equation becomes:
$1,350 = $609 + $644 - x
Subtracting $609 from each side yields:
$741 = $644 - x
Adding x to both sides gives us:
x + $741 = $644
To find out what x equals, subtract $741 from both sides:
x = $-741
However, since negative values aren't possible here, there must have been an error or misunderstanding somewhere.
If we assume that the question meant ""during"" instead of ""comprising,"" then it would make more sense. In other words, the sum of the wages during the first 7 days, plus the sum of the wages during the last 7 days, should equal the total amount earned during those 15 days ($1,350). Based on that understanding, here's how you could solve the problem:
First Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 87 = $609
Last Total Earning = No. of Days × Average Wage/Day
= 7 × 92 = $644
Finally, we set up an equation:
First Total Earning + Last Total Earning = Grand Total
= $609 + $644 - x
But again, our original assumption made no such constraint. So, unfortunately, without knowing the exact intended meaning of the prompt, there isn't enough information to solve the problem accurately."
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Let x be the price per bottle for B. In order to find out how many dollars we need to pay for B bottles, we first divide the number of cents needed for 27 bottles by 100 to get the amount spent in dollars (since there are 100 cents in a dollar).

The formula is: Number of dollars = (Number of cents) / 100

For 27 bottles, the total number of cents would be: (Price per bottle × Number of bottles) or AC. So, let's plug this into our formula above and solve for x.

x = AC / 100 * B

Here's where we introduce some abbreviations to simplify things:
- C stands for the ""price per bottle"" for question A
- B stands for the ""number of bottles"" that we want to calculate the cost for

So, using our newly introduced variables, the equation becomes:

x = BC / 100

This gives us the price per bottle for B, which multiplied by the number of bottles B will yield the total cost in dollars. I hope this helps clarify!"
2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). In one week, there are seven days, but we care only about the specific days that James is running his sprints. So, in total, James runs:
- On Monday: 3 x 60 = 180 meters
- On Wednesday: 3 x 60 = 180 meters
- On Friday: 3 x 60 = 180 meters

So, adding up all the meters James runs on these specific days, we get:

In summary, over the course of one week, James runs a total of 540 meters during his sprint workouts."
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Firstly, calculate how many students are left after selecting those who chose Contemporary Dance (let's call this group ""Group A""). This is done by finding 80% (the complement to 20%) of the total number of students (which we can assume for now to be 20). So, Group A has `(20 * 0.8) = 16` students.

2. Next, find out how many of the students from Group A have chosen Jazz Dance (this will help us determine the size of another subgroup called ""Group B"" that includes all students choosing both Contemporary AND Jazz dances). To do so, take the size of Group A, which is 16, multiply it with the proportion of students choosing Jazz Dance in that group (0.25), which gives you `(16 * 0.25) = 4`. Therefore, there are 4 students in Group B.

3. The final step involves determining the total number of students who choose Hip-Hop Dance. Since we know that all other students not included in either Group A or Group B have selected Hip-Hop as their preferred dance form, we add up these two groups - Group C (remaining students from the original set of 20 minus the ones in Groups A & B) plus the four students from Group B. Here's the math:

   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = ((20 - 16) + 4)`
   
   Where the first part calculates the number of students in Group C and the second part adds the students in Group B. Simplifying the formula using parentheses, we get:
   
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (4 - 16 + 4)`
   
   Now let's simplify further:
    
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (-12 + 4)`
   
   `Total Students Choosing Hip Hop Dance = (-8)`
   
   However, since percentages cannot be negative, the question needs some adjustment. Percentage calculation requires dividing the numerator by the denominator and then multiplies it by 100%. That means we need to turn our result into a positive value. We can achieve this by doing the opposite operation on the given expression. Instead of looking at the amount of students choosing Hip-Hop Dance, let's look at the portion of the entire class that doesn't select Hip-Hop Dance. That way, we would have calculated the complement of what we were originally asked to calculate.

   For example, if 20% choose contemporary dance, 75% don't choose contemporary dance. If we want to convert any percentage figure back to its decimal equivalent, we divide the percentage figure by 100. And when dealing with ratios or proportions, we keep them in terms of decimals. Hence, instead of dealing with percentages, we use decimal values. Using similar logic to the one above, to find the percentage of the entire class that does NOT select Hip-Hop Dance, follow these steps:
     
      1. Calculate the portion of the class that chooses neither Contemporary nor Jazz Dancing; i.e., the students who only choose Hip-Hop Dance. Do this by subtracting the numbers of students who chose Contemporary (from Group A) and Jazz (from Group B) from the original class size. The remaining students belong to Group C. 
        
        `Students Not Selecting Hip-Hop Dance = Total Number Of Students - [Number Of Students Chosen Contemporary + Number Of Students Chosen Jazz]`
        
        `= 20 - [(16 × 0.2) + (4)]`
        
        `= 20 - 12`
        
        `= 8`
        
        There are 8 students in Group C, which include those who prefer either Contemporary OR Jazz but haven't opted for Hip-Hop Dance.
        
        Now, to find out what percentage of the entire class chooses neither Contemporary nor Jazz Dancing (i.e., the non-hip hop group), divide the number of students belonging to Group C by the total number of students and then multiply the result by 100.
        
        `Percentage Of Entire Class Not Choosing Hip-Hop Dance = ([Total Number Of Students - (Number Of Students Chosen Contemporary + Number Of Students Chosen Jazz)] / Total Number Of Students) x 100`

4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Find out how many total apples were ordered (red + green): 42 + 7 = 49

2. Calculate how many apples would have been given to each student who chose fruit (total number of apples divided by number of students wanting fruit): 49/9 = 5.44... (rounded down because we can't give fractional parts of an apple)

3. Multiply this value by the number of students who wanted fruit: 5 * 9 = 45 (the total number of apples that should have been distributed to those nine students)

4. Subtract the total number of apples expected to be given from the total number of apples originally ordered: 49 - 45 = 4 (extra apples left over)

So in summary, the school ended up with 4 extra apples."
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Carol and her mother picked a total of 45 carrots (29 + 16). Out of these, there are 38 good carrots. The number of bad carrots can be found using this information as well. Since we know that there are 38 good carrots out of 45, it means that the remaining 17 carrots (45 - 38) must be bad. Therefore, they had 17 bad carrots. To solve for the exact amount of bad carrots specifically picked by Carol or her mother, you would need to calculate which one picked more bad carrots based on the given situation. However, since the question didn't ask us to find that, let's focus just on finding the total number of bad carrots. So, the answer is 17 bad carrots in total."
6,SVAMP,Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total. If white t-shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages. How many white t-shirts does each package have?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Let's say that one package contains x number of white T-shirts.
Mom bought a total of 70 white T-shirts, which she divided into 14 packages. That means the total number of white T-shirts in all 14 packages is 70. Using the formula for finding the total sum (in this case, it would be to find the total number of shirts), we can write an equation with variables:
Total # of Shirts = Number of Packages * # of Shirts Per Package
So, let's substitute our known values:
Total # of Shirts = 14 * x (where 'x' represents the number of shirts per package)
But we already know the total number of shirts - there are 70 in total! We just need to isolate 'x'. This means solving for 'x', using inverse operations such as division or multiplication. To do so, divide both sides by 14 (the number of packages):
Total # of Shirts / 14 = (Number of Packages)(# of Shirts Per Package)/14
Or:
Total # of Shirts / Total # of Packages = Average # of Shirts Per Package
Solving for 'x':
(Total # of Shirts/Total # of Packages) * Total # of Packages = Total # of Shirts
And since we want to solve for 'x', we replace 'Total # of Shirts' on the right side of the original equation with its equivalent value:
(Number of Packages*# of Shirts Per Package) / Number of Packages = # of Shirts Per Package
Simplifying the above expression, we get:
# of Shirts Per Package = Total # of Shirts / Number of Packages
Substituting our given values:
# of Shirts Per Package = 70 / 14
Reducing the fraction, we get:
# of Shirts Per Package = 5 (since 70 divided by 14 equals 5 when simplified).

Therefore, each package has 5 white T-shirts."
7,SVAMP,Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Jesse needs to calculate how many square feet each room covers, then add up that number for every single one of her 20 rooms. Here's a breakdown:

- Each room is 19 feet (length) times 18 feet (width). That gives us 342 square feet per room.

So if Jesse has 20 rooms, we can find out how many total square feet are needed like this:

- To get the total square footage, multiply 342 square feet (per room) by 20 rooms (total): 6,840 square feet total.

That means Jesse would need around 6,840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all of her rooms!"
8,AddSub,There were 28 bales of hay in the barn. Tim stacked bales in the barn today. There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Before Tim started stacking, there were 28 bales of hay in the barn.
2. After Tim finished stacking, there are now 54 bales of hay in the barn.
3. To find out how many more bales Tim added to what was already in the barn, we subtract the number of bales that were originally in the barn (28) from the total number of bales in the barn after Tim is done stacking (54). The difference tells us how many new bales have been added.
   - Difference = Total number of bales after stacking - Number of bales before stacking
      - Difference = 54 - 28
         - Difference = 26

So, Tim added 26 more bales on top of the initial 28, making a grand total of 54 bales of hay in the barn. Therefore, Tim stored 26 additional bales in the barn."
9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"Let's call the number of roses that Mary cut ""x"". The original number of roses was 6, and after cutting x more roses, there are now 16 total roses in the vase.

We can set up an equation to find the value of x:

Original number + Number of flowers added = Total number of flowers
(6) + (x) = (16)

Subtracting the initial number from both sides:

Number of flowers added = Total number - Original number
x = (16) - (6)

Simplifying:

x = (10)

So Mary cut 10 roses."
10,SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,Zero-shot-CoT,"1. Each person contributed $45 to split the cost equally among them.
2. Since there were three people sharing the bill (Sally, Sam, and Alyssa), we can calculate how much one third ($30) would be using division with a remainder set equal to zero since there is no remainder for dividing by three:
    - Bill divided by number of people = Cost per person
        - Total Bill / Number of People = Cost Per Person
        - Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People

Using this formula:

- Total Bill / Number of People = Cost Per Person
- Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People

Let's plug in our known values:

Total Bill = Cost Per Person x Number of People
      = $45 x 3
      = $135

So, if each person paid $45, then they collectively spent $135 on their meal."

2. Find out how much flour has been added so far (here, that's 2 cups)
3. Subtract the current amount from the total amount required to get the remaining or missing amount of flour needed to complete the recipe (remaining = total - current). In other words, we want to know ""How many more cups do I need?"" So if you have used 2 cups and the recipe calls for 8 cups altogether, then subtract 2 from 8 to find out what number represents the remaining quantity of flour needed.
4. To calculate: 8-2=6
5. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour to her mixture to fulfill the requirements of the recipe."

State Park - This choice would involve hiking trails and open spaces, but not necessarily benches specifically located within trees. The answer could be any of the other options if we assume there are no other clues or context provided.

2. Bus Stop/Bus Depot - Neither of these locations typically have benches nestled in trees unless it's an unusual feature for some reason. However, they don't exclude the possibility either.

3. Statue - A statue may have a bench nearby to accommodate people who want to sit down while admiring the artwork, but again, this doesn't guarantee the presence of benches nestled in trees.

4. Train Station - Similar to statues, train stations might have benches around them, but not necessarily under the canopy of trees.

However, schools are typically equipped with sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and other emergency measures to address potential fires. Additionally, most schools do not allow open flames or cooking appliances within classrooms, reducing the risk of fires. Therefore, while having a fire extinguisher at a school would still be an excellent idea for certain situations, it is not as crucial as in boats or hospitals due to other safety protocols already being in place.

2. We know that none of the people mentioned in this problem flipped or reversed the coin. Therefore, it remains in its current state, which is heads up (H).
3. The answer to our question is yes; the coin is still heads up after no one flipped it.

In other words, there was no change made to the coin because nobody flipped it, so it remained unchanged and continued being heads up."

0,AQuA,"The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Variables and Numerical Values:
- Average Wage for Fortnight = $90 per day
- Average Wage for First Seven Days = $87 per day
- Average Wage for Last Seven Days = $92 per day

To find the wage on the 8th Day:
We know that the total earnings in 15 consecutive working days is given as: 
Total Earnings = ($90 x 15)
But we also have another piece of information which tells us that the total earning from the first seven days were $609 (calculated using Total Earning from First Seven Days = ($87 x 7))
This means that the remaining earnings would be calculated as:
Remaining Earnings = Total Earnings - Total Earnings From First Seven Days
Substituting the values, we get:
Remaining Earnings = ($90 x 15) - ($609)

Now, since there are still 8 more working days left after the end of the seventh day, the remaining earnings need to be divided among those eight days. Thus, we can say that each of these days will earn an amount equal to this remaining earnings divided by 8, i.e., Remaining Earnings / Number of Working Days Left.
So, the wage for the 8th day is given as:
Wage for 8th Day = Remaining Earnings / Number of Working Days Left
Substituting the values, we get:
Wage for 8th Day = [($90 x 15) - ($609)]/8
Simplifying further:
Wage for 8th Day = [$90 * 15] + (-$609)/8
Calculate Intermediate Results:
[The negative sign before $609 indicates subtraction.]
[The division with remainder option has been used here so that the value of quotient is displayed along with any possible remainders.]
(-$609)÷ 8 = $-76.125 (remainder is zero)
Therefore, Wage for 8th Day = [$90 * 15] + (-$609)/8
= ($90 * 15) + (-$609) / 8
= $1,350 - $76.125
= $1,273.875
Rounded off to two decimal places, the final result is:
Wage for 8th Day = $1,273.88

Answer according to choices provided in question:
(C) $90

Since our calculations revealed that the wage earned on the 8th day should be $1,273.88, it's clear that choice C does not match the actual wage earned on the 8th day. Therefore, Choice C cannot be the answer.

Hence, the answer is (E): $1,040.

Explanation:
From the available choices, only one number seems plausible because it appears between the other numbers given above. That is why we choose $1,040. This represents the average earnings per day over the entire fortnight, or $1,040 divided by 15, which gives us $69.33 per day. If we assume that the wage on the 8th day was less than what is being offered by all other choices, then we might expect to see the same pattern throughout the rest of the workdays in terms of decreasing income. However, based on our earlier calculations, we found that the wage earned on the 8th day was actually higher than what most people think due to the way they interpreted the data. In fact, the highest wage earned during the fortnight was on the very next day, specifically, the 9th day. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information about the exact timing and duration of each shift worked by the employee to pinpoint exactly when and where the highest wage occurred. Nonetheless, it's safe to conclude that choosing an answer anywhere within the range suggested by the multiple choice options is highly unlikely considering how precise the original data was. Moreover, since the answer presented itself as an isolated figure rather than part of a larger trend, we can safely eliminate all possibilities except for one. With this in mind, it becomes easier to narrow down the correct answer from the given set of alternatives.

In conclusion, the right answer would be (E) $1,040, but if you want to double-check your math, you can compare this answer against the intermediate results mentioned in my previous response. As long as both answers agree, then you"
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let x represent the number of bottles of soda that costs B cents each.

The given information is:
- The price for 27 bottles of soda is A cents.
   - To convert this into dollars, we need to divide by 100 since one cent equals $0.01.
   
- We want to find the price per bottle for x bottles.
   - This can be calculated as: price per bottle = total price / number of bottles

Total price for 27 bottles is A cents or $A/100.
Number of bottles for x is x.
Price per bottle for x is equal to the total price divided by the number of bottles: $((A/100)/x)*100$
But we are looking for cents, not dollars. So we need to multiply it by 100 again: $(A/(100*x))*100$.

To get from dollars to cents, we just drop the dollar sign, so our final answer is:
$(A/(100*x))$

Now back to your question, if you have B bottles instead of X, then using the formula above with B replacing x:

price per bottle for B bottles = ($(A/100)/B)*100$

This gives us an expression in terms of A and B. However, we're trying to find the price per bottle in dollars based on B's price per bottle (in cents). Therefore, we would like to simplify this expression further by solving for the price per bottle in cents and then converting that to dollars. Let's do that now:

1. Simplifying the expression:

First, note that to cancel out ""100"" in the denominator, we can take its reciprocal which is ""1/100"". Doing so yields:

price per bottle for B bottles = ((A/100)/B)*100*(1/100)$

We can combine the last two factors inside parentheses:

price per bottle for B bottles = (A/100^2)*B$

Next, let's factor out ""A"":

price per bottle for B bottles = (A/100^2)*(B/100)$

Finally, let's simplify this expression:

price per bottle for B bottles = (BA^{-2})*100^-3$$

2. Converting to dollars:

Now we know the price per bottle in terms of cents; however, we'd like to express this value in dollars. For that, we simply divide the value obtained in cents by 100 (since there are 100 pennies in every dollar):

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2}/100^3) * (1/100)$

Simplifying this equation:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = BA^{-2}*10^-5$

Thus, the formula for finding the price per bottle in dollars when purchasing B bottles at a rate of A cents per bottle is:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2})*10^-5$

Returning to your original question, here's what you were asking:

If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars?

Solution: Use the newly derived formula to determine the price per bottle in dollars based on buying B bottles at a rate of A cents per bottle. Plugging in the values provided, we obtain:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (BA^{-2})*10^-5$

Substituting the known quantities:

price per bottle for B bottles in dollars = (B*A^{-2})*10^-5$

Therefore, the cost in dollars for B bottles is found by multiplying the resulting price per bottle for B bottles in dollars by B. In other words, C=BCp, where C represents the total cost for B bottles in dollars, and Cp is the price per bottle in dollars, which was determined previously. I hope that helps clarify things!

2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"1. Understand the Problem:
James is running three sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week. We need to find out how many total meters he's running per week. 

2. Extract Relevant Variables & Numerals:
- Number of sprints: 3 (per day) x 3 (days in a week) = 9 sprints/week
- Distance for one sprint: 60 meters

3. Devise Plan:
Calculate the total distance James covers every time he runs all nine sprints in a week. Then, multiply this value with the number of weeks he runs this way for an entire year. This will tell us his total annual mileage.

4. Calculate Intermediate Results:
First, we'll figure out how far James runs during one session or ""workout"" (three sprints). A single workout is made up of three sprints that are 60m long. So, James runs 60*3=180m during a single workout. 
Next, since James works out three times a week, he completes 9 workouts in seven days, which means he runs 9 * 180m = 1620 m (rounded off to two decimal places) per week.

5. Solve the Problem Step By Step:
To determine James' annual distance traveled, we would take our weekly result from above and then multiple it by the number of weeks in a year (52):

1620 m per week × 52 weeks per year = 84,976,000 m per year (rounded off to four decimal places)

So, if James continues to follow his current regimen, he could cover over 84 million meters (or about 52,719 miles!) annually while training at his current pace! But remember, the numbers might be larger than those given as inputs in real life problems because they have been rounded off.

Note: In general, you can use the formula Total_Distance = No_Sprints_Per_Workout * Length_Of_Each_Sprint * No_Workouts_In_Week * Weeks_Trained_During_Year to calculate the total distance covered by someone who trains regularly."
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"1) Extracting Relevant Variables and Their Corresponding Numerals:
Number of total students = 20
Percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% (or 0.2)
Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20 * 0.2 = 4
Remaining Students after taking away those who are enrolled in Contemporary Dance = Total Number of Students - Students Enrolled in Contemporary Dance
                                                = 20 - 4
                                                = 16

Percentage of Students Remaining who enroll in Jazz Dance = 25% (or 0.25)
Number of Students Enrolled in Jazz Dance = Percentage of Students Remaining x Number of Students After Taking Away Those Who Are Enrolled in Contemporary Dance
                                           = 0.25 x 16
                                           = 4

Remaining Students After Taking Away Those Who Enrolled in Contemporary Dance or Jazz Dance = Total Number of Students - (Students Enrolled in Contemporary Dance + Students Enrolled in Jazz Dance)
                                             = 20 - (4+4)
                                             = 8

Let's find the number of students that enroll in Hip Hop Dance. We know there were originally 8 students left who didn't take either contemporary or jazz. If none took hip hop initially, then this is the maximum possible value for ""students enrolling in hip hop"" from here onward. However, since we have been given percentages rather than raw numbers so far, we need to convert what we do know about the other two categories into similar terms before proceeding with our calculation. To translate the remaining students not involved in either contemporary or jazz dance as a percentage of the original group, divide the number of those remaining by the total student count, i.e., the initial percentage was 8/20 or 40%. Now, if we assume no overlap between these three groups, then any one of them could be selected independently; in other words, they are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, if only 20% of all students choose contemporary dance and 25% of the remainder choose jazz dance, then the probability of selecting someone for hip-hop would be equal to [the complement of choosing contemporary OR jazz] x [remainder]. Using mathematical expressions, the following can be written. Complement of choosing contemporary dance: (100% - 20%)
Complement of choosing contemporary AND jazz dance: 100% minus the product of individual probabilities (which is not necessary in this case because they don't share any students). The formula will look like this:
(100% - [probability of contemporary] - [probability of jazz]) x [percentage of remaining students]. So, the probability of choosing someone for hip-hop becomes:
((100% - 20%) - 25%) x 40%
= 70% x 40%
= 28%

Now, to get the actual number of students who chose hip hop, multiply 28% with the total number of students, which is 20. This gives us an answer of approximately 5.6 students who enrolled in hip hop dance, but rounded up to the nearest integer gives us 6. Answer: Approximately 6 (rounded up) % of the total students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

However, some assumptions were made when calculating the above values. One major assumption was that each category of dance is independent of others, meaning that a person cannot enroll in more than one type of dance simultaneously. It is possible that some students might have joined multiple classes, and thus, this method may yield less accurate results.

In practice, it would require further information regarding how many students took multiple classes, or whether there were separate lists provided for every dance form. Without such data available, however, using the method described previously would give approximate answers based solely on what has already been presented.

Therefore, while using the percentage approach, always bear in mind its limitations and assumptions. Try to verify your solution whenever possible."
4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's assign some variable names to make it easier to follow along:
- r = number of red apples ordered
- g = number of green apples ordered
- n = number of students who want fruit
- x = number of extra apples left over

We know that:
r + g = total number of apples ordered (which is given)

So we have:
42 + 7 = 49 (total number of apples ordered)

Also, since there are fewer than half as many green apples compared to red ones, we can say that:
g < r/2

This means that there will be more leftover red apples than green apples (because they have more in stock). Therefore, we can assume that most likely all the green apples were eaten or distributed among the students who chose them. However, this does not necessarily mean that all the red apples were taken either because maybe more students took red apples than just those who asked for fruit.

To find out exactly what happened, we need to see how many apples each student got on average using the formula:
(total number of fruits shared)/(number of students)

In our case:
(red apples + green apples) / (students choosing fruit)
= (42 * 0.5 + 7) / 9  # assuming that every student who chose fruit got at least one apple (since both types of apples were available)
≈ 8.66 apples per student

Since each student received an integer amount of apples (either whole or halved), we round down when calculating the exact number of apples consumed by the students who selected fruit. This means that less than 1 full apple was consumed in total.

Now, let's do some calculations based on the above information. We know that:
n * avg_apples_per_student = total number of apples eaten

Therefore:
9 * 8 = 72 (total number of apples eaten by those who chose fruit)

The remaining apples would be:
49 - 72 = 23 (the total number of unused and uneaten apples)

Of these 23 apples, the vast majority will be from the red category, so let's assume that almost all of them belong to the group of ""extra"" red apples. Based on this assumption:
x ≈ 23 (we don't know the exact value of x yet, but we estimate it should be close to 23)

But wait! What if some of the red apples were also used by other students (maybe they had seconds or chose to take two instead of one)? In order to account for this possibility, let's subtract any potential red apples already eaten by non-fruit eaters:

If we assume that about 5% of the students who didn't choose fruit still ended up eating red apples (even though they weren't supposed to), then approximately:
0.05 * 36 (total number of students not selecting fruit) * 0.5 (each student gets at least one apple) * 2 (some students may have chosen two) = 1.2 apples (potential apples wasted due to error or double servings)

These wasted red apples could potentially be considered part of the excess inventory, but we won't add them unless we have concrete evidence that they were indeed lost or thrown away. Since we cannot confirm whether these wasted apples actually occurred, we will exclude them for now. This gives us:
x = 23 - 1.2 (estimated number of unused and uneaten red apples)

Finally, let's revise our original estimation for the exact number of unused and uneaten apples based on the calculated result above:
x ≈ 21.8 apples (rounded down to the nearest integer)

It seems like quite a few red apples went to waste, which could be a concern for the school's budget and sustainability efforts. It might be worthwhile for the school to investigate why so many red apples remain unconsumed and to consider alternative options such as distributing smaller portions, reducing portion sizes overall, or offering a wider variety of fruits."
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's assume that the total number of carrots in the garden is ""x."" In this case, we can create an equation using the given information:

Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = Total Carrots (Good + Bad)
(29 for Carol) + (16 for Mom) = x (Total Carrots)

Now, if there are a total of 38 good carrots, then the remaining ones must be bad. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of Good Carrots = Number of Good Carrots for Carol + Number of Good Carrots for Mom
38 = 29 (for Carol) + 9 (Remaining Good Carrots for Mom)

Subtracting the number of good carrots found earlier from our original equation, we get:

Total Carrots - Total Good Carrots = Total Bad Carrots
x - 38 = Total Bad Carrots

Using substitution with the variable 'x', we can solve for the total bad carrots:

Original Equation:
Carol's carrots + Mother's carrots = Total Carrots (Good + Bad)
(29 for Carol) + (16 for Mom) = x (Total Carrots)

New Equation (adding both equations):
x - 38 = Total Bad Carrots
(29 for Carol) + (16 for Mom) + (x - 38) = Original Equation
55 = Total Carrots (Good + Bad)

Therefore, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from 55 to find the total bad carrots:

Total Bad Carrots = Total Carrots - Total Good Carrots
Bad Carrots = 55 - 38
Bad Carrots = 17

So, Carol and her mom had 17 bad carrots in addition to the 38 good ones.

The answer would be 17."
6,SVAMP,Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total. If white t-shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages. How many white t-shirts does each package have?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's call the number of shirts per package as ""x"". Since she bought 14 packages, we know that:

14 * x = 70 (total number of shirts)

To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 14:

x = (70/14) or x = 5

So, there are 5 white t-shirts in each package."
7,SVAMP,Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"We can find the area of each room by multiplying the length and width: 19 ft × 18 ft = 342 sq ft per room. Since there are 20 rooms, we need to calculate how many square feet of carpet is needed for all 20 rooms. To do this, we can simply multiply the number of rooms (20) with the area per room (342 sq ft):

Total Square Feet Needed = Number of Rooms x Area Per Room
                           = 20 × 342 sq ft
                           = 6,840 sq ft of carpet required to cover all the rooms.

So Jesse needs around 6,840 sq ft of carpet to cover the floors of her 20 rooms."
8,AddSub,There were 28 bales of hay in the barn. Tim stacked bales in the barn today. There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Variables:
- Total number of bales initially (before Tim added more) = 28
- Number of bales added by Tim =?
- Total number of bales after adding by Tim = 54

Let's create an equation with our known values to find the unknown value for the number of bales that Tim stored in the barn:

Total number of bales before + Number of bales added by Tim = Total number of bales after

Solving for the number of bales added by Tim:

28 + x = 54
x = 54 - 28
x = 26

So, Tim stacked 26 more bales in the barn. The total number of bales is now 54."
9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Plan of action:
1. Identify the initial number of roses in the vase: 6
2. Find the difference between the final and initial numbers of roses: Final - Initial = Difference
3. Calculate the final number of roses using subtraction: Total Roses (Final) - Total Roses (Initial) = Number Of Roses Added/Cut
4. Subtract the original number of roses in the vase from the total number of roses to find how many more roses have been added or taken away.
5. Solve for ""Number Of Roses Cut"" by finding the difference between the total roses before adding new ones and the total roses after cutting.

Solution:
Let's say Mary added x roses to the vase when she brought them over. The total number of roses in the vase is equal to the sum of the original number of roses plus the number of additional roses that Mary brought. So, we can write an equation:

Total Roses (New) = Original Roses + Additional Roses
                           = 6 + x

Now, given that there are 16 roses in the vase after Mary has finished cutting and adding roses, we can set up another equation using this information as well. We know that the total number of roses after Mary has done both tasks should be equal to the total number of roses before Mary started doing anything minus the number of roses that Mary cut off AND PLUS THE NUMBER OF ROSES THAT MARY ADDED TO THE VASE. Thus, our second equation would look like:

Total Roses (After Adding And Removing Roses) = Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses) – Number Of Roses That Mary Cut Off + Number Of Roses That Mary Added To The Vase
                                               = 6 – Number Of Roses Cut Off + x

Finally, since these two equations represent the same situation, they must be equivalent. Therefore, setting the left-hand sides of each equation equal will result in:

Original Roses + Additional Roses = Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses) – Number Of Roses That Mary Cut Off + x

Substituting the right side of the above formula with the expression for ""Total Roses (Before Adding Or Removing Roses)"" which was derived in Equation #1:

6 + x = 6 – Number Of Roses Cut Off + x

Simplifying, we get:

x = Number Of Roses Cut Off

Therefore, if Mary had originally 6 roses in the vase and then she cuts off n roses, it means that she takes n roses from 6 roses initially available. After she does that, she adds x more roses to the vase. Since we know that the end result shows 16 roses in the vase, the number of roses cut off can be calculated as follows:

Number Of Roses Cut Off = Total Roses Before (6) – Total Roses After (16) + X (total number of roses she added)
        	= 6 – 16 + x
        	= -10 + x

However, because the number of roses cannot be negative, we need to adjust this solution. When we add x roses and take n roses away, we actually ADD (-n) roses to account for the fact that we took n roses AWAY. In other words, what we really want to do is to ADD (-N) roses instead of taking them away so that we don't create a negative value. This modification allows us to use simple addition to find the number of roses that Mary added while accounting for the number of roses that Mary removed. Hence, the modified equation looks like:

Number Of Roses Cut Off = Total Roses Before (6) – Total Roses After (16) + X (total number of roses she added) – (-N) (number of roses she cut off)
            	= 6 – 16 + x - (-N)
            	= -10 + x + N

Using this adjusted equation, we can conclude that:

If Mary had 6 roses in the vase at first, but later on, she added x roses and cut off n roses, then:

The number of roses that Mary cut off is: N = -(10 + x)

In this particular case, we already know that x is positive because we were told that Mary added some roses (i.e., x > 0). Also, we know that N needs to"
10,SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's assume that there were X number of items on the menu for the three individuals to share equally. Each item costs Y dollars per serving or portion. Therefore, the total cost of all the shared items would be calculated as follows:

X * Y = Total Cost of Shared Items

Each individual shares an equal amount of this total cost. So if each person pays Z dollars, we can find Z using the following formula:

Z/3 = Total Cost of Shared Items / 3

Substituting for the previously found expression for ""Total Cost of Shared Items"" gives us:

(X * Y) / 3 = Z

In our example, Z is known because each person paid $45. Substitute it into the equation above:

$45 = (Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)/3

To isolate the unknown value of Number of Items (X), we need to perform some algebraic manipulations. First, multiply both sides of the equation with 3:

$(Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)*3=135$

Then divide both sides by $(Dollar Amount Per Serving)$:

$(Number of Items x Dollar Amount Per Serving)*3/(Dollar Amount Per Serving)=135/$($Dollar Amount Per Serving)$

The last expression simplifies to X*3=135/$($Dollar Amount Per Serving)$

So, to determine how many items they ordered in total, we divide 135 by ($Dollar Amount Per Serving$) multiplied by 3. For instance, suppose that each dish costs $20. The number of dishes that the group ordered will then be:

X*3=(135/$20)/3

X*(1)=6.75

However, since you cannot order half a dish, round up to get the nearest integer, so the total number of dishes is 7.

Therefore, the group ordered 7 dishes altogether that they split evenly among themselves. To find the price per dish, we simply take the dollar amount for one serving ($20) and divide by 7, which equals approximately $2.86.

If the total cost of the meal was $45 per person, then they must have spent $135 collectively on the seven meals, or $19.29 per dish. This means that they ended up over-ordering slightly by paying $1.29 more than the true average cost per dish. However, considering that food prices tend to fluctuate, a small discrepancy such as this should not cause any significant financial loss for the restaurant or inconvenience for its customers."
11,SingleEq,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe wants 8 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups. How many more cups does she need to add?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Let's identify the variable and its value so far:
- Total amount of flour required according to the recipe = 8 cups
- Amount of flour added by Mary so far = 2 cups

To find out how much more flour Mary needs to add, we can subtract the total amount that has been added from the total amount needed as follows:
- Remaining amount of flour needed: 8 - 2 = 6 cups

So, Mary still needs to add another 6 cups of flour to complete her recipe for this particular batch of cake."
12,CSQA,What is a place that has a bench nestled in trees? Answer Choices: (A) state park (B) bus stop (C) bus depot (D) statue (E) train station,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Based on the question provided, we can identify some relevant variables such as location, presence of benches, trees, public transportation facilities like bus stops or stations, and statues. However, none of these locations have been explicitly mentioned as having all of these features except for one - a state park. State parks often feature trails with benches placed under trees along them to provide rest areas for hikers and nature enthusiasts. Bus stops, bus depots, train stations, and statues do not necessarily involve trees or benches. Therefore, ""state park"" would be the correct answer.

So, if we assume there's only one choice available, the answer should be A, state park. If multiple choices were given, then we could eliminate options B, C, D, and E based on our analysis above. However, since it wasn't specified whether more than one option was presented, we cannot conclude which letter corresponds to this answer other than A."
13,CSQA,Where is a good idea but not required to have a fire extinguisher? Answer Choices: (A) school bus (B) boat (C) house (D) hospital (E) school,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"To answer this question based on given choices, it's necessary to know that having a fire extinguisher on board boats or ships is highly recommended for emergency situations in case of small fires. However, it's also mandatory to have a fire suppression system installed on larger vessels as per International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards. So, while having a fire extinguisher on a boat isn't necessarily legally mandated, it would be considered a good idea due to safety reasons. In contrast, schools are already legally required to have fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and properly functioning fire extinguishers under various state and local codes. Hospitals and houses don't fall into any legal requirement either because they usually meet strict building codes, including requirements regarding smoke detectors, fire alarm systems, and other life-safety equipment. Therefore, having a fire extinguisher in those places can still be beneficial, but there aren't specific laws requiring them. Based on these considerations, although having a fire extinguisher is an excellent idea in most settings, answering ""school"" might be misleading since it implies that no law requires schools to have one - which contradicts the fact that many states and cities require fire safety measures in educational facilities. The correct answer should be option B, i.e., boat.

In short, the answer to the original question is B - Boat."
14,StrategyQA,Does the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exist?,zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"The question asked is whether the country that won the most gold medals in the 1976 Olympic Games still exists today.

To answer this question, we need to know which country won the most gold medals at those games. According to historical records, East Germany won the most gold medals with a total of 28 golds out of a possible 45 medal wins for them. The next highest was Hungary with 10 gold medals.

As for whether these countries still exist today, both East Germany and West Germany were reunified as one nation called Germany on October 3, 1990. Therefore, East Germany no longer officially exists as an independent state, but its successor state, Germany, does. So, Germany did win the most number of gold medals during the 1976 Olympic Games, albeit under different political circumstances than what currently exists."

16,Last Letters,"'Take the last letters of each words in ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"" and concatenate them'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Here are the steps we can follow to solve this task:
1. Identify the string ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"".
2. Extract the last letter from each word using Python slicing syntax with negative indexes (-1):
    - Last letter of ""Lino"": ""n""
    - Last letter of ""Mariel"": ""l""
    - Last letter of ""Aditya"": ""a""
    - Last letter of ""Elisabeth"": ""b""
3. Concatenate the resulting strings using the `join()` method:
   - First, create an empty list called `last_letters`.
   - Append each last letter to that list using list comprehension.
   - Use the `join()` function to join all the elements of the resulting list into one string.
4. Print or return the final result.

In Python code:
```python
string = ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth""
last_letters = [letter[-1] for letter in string.split()] # Split string at spaces then get last character of each word.
result = ''.join(last_letters) # Join all last characters together as a new string.
print(result)
# Output: ""thbetlbihseiradtyaaelrislehrmnilo""
```
Alternatively:
```python
last_letters = []
for i in range(-1, len(""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth""), -1):
    if i >= len(""Lino""):
        last_letters.append(((""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"")[i]).lower())
last_letters = ''.join(last_letters).replace(' ', '')
print(last_letters)

17,Last Letters,"'Take the last letters of each words in ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"" and concatenate them'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"In this case, there is no need for calculations or intermediate steps since we are only dealing with string manipulation. The question asks us to take the last letter of each word from the given name and concatenate them.

Firstly, we split the string into individual words using spaces as delimiters. This gives us an array containing each word separately.

```javascript
let input = ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"";
let arr = input.split("" "");
console.log(arr);
// Output: [""Jacky"", ""Socorro"", ""Mark"", ""Wanda""]
```

Next, we can loop through the array `arr` starting at index 0 and ending at index `length - 1`, taking the last character of each word and storing it in a new empty variable called `lastLetters`. To get the last character of each word, we can use `slice()` method which takes two arguments, the start index (inclusive) and end index (exclusive). In our case, the start index will always be `-1` (the last index) and the length of the word as the second argument (since we want to slice up until one less than the end).

```javascript
let input = ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"";
let arr = input.split("" "");
let lastLetters = """"; // Initialize empty string to store last characters
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    lastLetters += arr[i].slice(-1)[0]; // Adding the result of the slice operation to lastLetter variable
}
console.log(lastLetters);
// Output: ""aydkn""
```

The output shows that the last letters of each word have been concatenated together. Note how we used the bracket notation `[]` on the result returned by the `slice()` function to access its value inside another pair of square brackets. We also appended the resulting value to the `lastLetters` variable inside the loop body using the `+=` operator. Finally, we printed the final result `lastLetters` to console."
18,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Walter does not flip the coin. Mikayla does not flip the coin. Larry does not flip the coin. Ryan does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse"".'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Variables: Coin's orientation (heads or tails) after all flips are completed
- Initial state of the coin: Heads up (H)
- Names of individuals who did not flip the coin: Walter, Mikayla, Larry, and Ryan

Plan: Determine whether any of these four people flipped the coin and if so, what was its result; then find out if there were any other flips besides those mentioned in the given information. If there were no additional flips, determine whether the final orientation of the coin is still H based on the initial state and the actions taken.

Calculation and Common Sense: None of the listed individuals flipped the coin. Therefore, we can assume that the final orientation of the coin remains as it was at the beginning, which is Heads Up. However, since the term ""flip"" actually refers to ""reversing,"" this could also mean that the coin remained Heads Up because none of them reversed it. It's unclear from the original statement whether someone else might have flipped the coin during the process, but without additional context or information, we cannot make that assumption either way.

Overall, our conclusion would be that there is insufficient evidence to say for certain whether the coin is still Heads Up or has been switched due to an unknown external event. The question may require further clarification before a definitive answer can be provided."
19,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Lorena does not flip the coin. Shana does not flip the coin. Priscilla does not flip the coin. Summer does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse""'",zephyr-7b-alpha,PS+,"Problem understanding:
- The question asks whether the coin remains heads up even though no one flipped it (reversed its position). In other words, if we know that initially the coin was heads up, but no one has performed any action on it since then, would the coin remain in a heads-up position or not?

Variables and their values:
- Coin position: Initially heads up (value of 1)
- Flipping actions: None performed for all individuals mentioned in the prompt (values of 0)

Plan: Calculate the new value of the coin based on the given information.

Calculation: If there are no changes made to the initial state (heads up), then the final value should be the same as the initial value. Since none of the people listed have flipped the coin, the final value of the coin can only depend on the initial value. Therefore, the final value of the coin must also be heads up with a value of 1.

Solution: Yes, the coin will remain heads up because no one has reversed its position. The final value of the coin is still 1.

Note: This problem seems straightforward, however, always pay careful attention to the language used in problems like this to avoid misunderstandings. For instance, ""flips"" in the context of coins could mean either physically turning over the coin or changing the outcome of a coin toss from heads to tails, so clarify which meaning applies before proceeding with your solution."
