0,AQuA,"The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for calculating average wages over a period of time:

average wage = total wage / number of days

We are given three pieces of information about the worker's wages over a 15-day period:

* Average wage for all 15 days: $90
* Average wage for the first 7 days: $87
* Average wage for the last 7 days: $92

Let's assume that the worker worked every single day in both periods (i.e., there were no non-working days). Then we can set up an equation using these values:

(total wage for first 7 days) + (total wage for last 7 days) = (total wage for all 15 days)

$87 \times 7 + $92 \times 7 = $90 \times 15

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$609 + $656 = $1350

Combining like terms, we get:

$1265 = $1350

This means that the total wage earned by the worker over the entire 15-day period was not enough to cover the cost of living for those days. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact wage paid to the worker on the 8th day based solely on the given information."
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," To convert the number of bottles from one unit to another, we need to know the conversion factor. In this case, we are asked to convert from cents to dollars. We can use the following conversion factors:

* 1 cent = $0.01
* 1 dollar = 100 cents

Using these conversion factors, we can calculate the cost of B bottles as follows:

Cost of B bottles = Number of bottles \* Cost per bottle
= B \* ($0.01 / 1 cent)
= B \* $0.01

Therefore, the cost of B bottles in dollars is equal to B times $0.01."
2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the number of sprints he runs per week and then multiply that by the distance of each sprint. Here's the calculation step-by-step:

1. First, let's figure out how many sprints James runs per week. Since he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, this means:
Sprints per week = Sprints per day \* Days per week
= 3 sprints/day \* 3 days/week
= 9 sprints/week
2. Next, we need to determine the total distance James runs during these sprints. We know he runs 60 meters for each sprint, so:
Total distance = Number of sprints \* Distance per sprint
= 9 sprints \* 60 meters/sprint
= 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters every week."
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," Let's break down this problem step by step:
1. We know that there are 20 students in total.
2. First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = (20/100) * 20 = 4 students.
3. Now we need to calculate how many students remained after those who enrolled in contemporary dance left: 20 - 4 = 16 students.
4. Next, let's find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of 16 = (16/100) * 25 = 4 students.
5. Finally, we can determine how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dances from the total number of students: 20 - (4 + 4) = 20 - 8 = 12 students.
6. To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12/20) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is that 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," 33 extra apples.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. First, we need to find out how many total apples were ordered by the school: 42 red + 7 green = 50 apples.
2. Next, we know that only 9 students want fruit, so the school needs to prepare enough apples for those 9 students.
3. To do this, they would divide the number of apples needed (for the 9 students) by the average size of an apple (which is assumed to be about 6 oz): 9 / 6 = 1.5 apples per student.
4. Since each student gets one apple, there are still 8 more apples left over (9 - 1 = 8).
5. However, since these remaining apples are not part of the original order, but rather leftovers from previous days or possibly damaged fruits, it's reasonable to assume that none of them can be used again.
6. Therefore, the final answer is that the cafeteria ended up with 33 extra apples (50 - 17 = 33)."
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," There are 5 bad carrots.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. In total, Carol and her mother picked 45 carrots (29 + 16).
2. They only found 38 of these carrots to be good.
3. To find out how many bad carrots there were, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots picked: 45 - 38 = 7.

Therefore, there were 7 bad carrots in their garden."
6,SVAMP,Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total. If white t-shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages. How many white t-shirts does each package have?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot, Each package has 5 white t-shirts.
7,SVAMP,Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," To calculate how much carpet Jesse needs, we first need to find out the total area of one room. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of a single room together:

Area of one room = Length x Width
= 19 ft x 18 ft
= 342 sq ft

Next, we'll multiply this value by the number of rooms Jesse has (which is 20):

Total area needed = Area of one room x Number of rooms
= 342 sq ft x 20
= 6840 sq ft

Therefore, Jesse will need 6,840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms."

How many bales did he store in the barn?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," 26 bales. To find this, subtract the initial number of bales from the final number of bales: 54 - 28 = 26."
9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot, 10 roses.
10,SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation that represents the situation where three people are paying a bill in equal shares. Let's call the total amount of the bill ""x"". We can then write the following equation:
```scss
Sally + Sam + Alyssa = x
```
We know that each person pays $45, so we can rewrite the equation as follows:
```css
$45 + $45 + $45 = x
```
Combining the terms on the left side gives us:
```css
135 = x
```
Therefore, the total amount of the bill was $135."

18,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Walter does not flip the coin. Mikayla does not flip the coin. Larry does not flip the coin. Ryan does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse"".'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," Yes, the coin is still heads up.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We know that a coin can be flipped to either heads or tails.
2. However, in this scenario, we are told that none of the individuals (Walter, Mikayla, Larry, and Ryan) have flipped the coin.
3. Since no one has flipped the coin, it remains in its original state, which is heads up.
4. Therefore, even though none of the individuals have physically flipped the coin, the question asks if the coin is still heads up, and the answer is yes since it hasn't been flipped to tails."
19,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Lorena does not flip the coin. Shana does not flip the coin. Priscilla does not flip the coin. Summer does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse""'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot," Yes, the coin is still heads up.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We know that a coin can be flipped to either heads or tails. However, in this scenario, we are specifically referring to flipping the coin as reversing its orientation (i.e., turning it over).
2. Since none of the individuals mentioned in the question have flipped the coin, it remains in its original position and orientation.
3. Therefore, even though Lorena, Shana, Priscilla, and Summer did not flip the coin, it is still heads up because they did not reverse its orientation."
0,AQuA,"The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," We know that the total wage earned over the 15-day period is $90 x 15 = $<<90*15=1350>>1350.
The sum of the wages earned in the first 7 days is $87 x 7 = $<<87*7=609>>609.
Similarly, the sum of the wages earned in the last 7 days is $92 x 7 = $<<92*7=644>>644.
Therefore, the combined wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days is $609 + $644 = $<<609+644=1253>>1253.
Since we know that the total wage earned over the 15-day period is $1350, we can subtract the combined wage from this to find out the wage earned on the 8th day: $1350 - $1253 = $<<1350-1253=107>>107.
So, the answer is (C) $90."
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," First, we need to convert the number of bottles from centimeters to milliliters. We know that there are 1000 milliliters in a liter and 100 centimeters in a meter. Therefore, each bottle contains 1000 x 100 = 100,000 milliliters.

Next, let's calculate the total volume of soda in milliliters for 27 bottles:
Total Volume = Number of Bottles x Volume per Bottle
Total Volume = 27 x 100,000 ml
Total Volume = 2,700,000 ml

Now, we can convert this volume to liters by dividing it by 1000:
Total Volume = 2,700,000 ml / 1000 = 2700 L

Finally, we can convert this volume to dollars using the conversion factor $1/L:
Cost = Total Volume x Conversion Factor
Cost = 2700 L x $1/L
Cost = $2700

Therefore, 27 bottles of soda would cost $2700."
2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," First, we need to find out how many sprints James runs in a week. Since he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, that means:

Sprints per week = Sprints per day * Days per week
= 3 sprints * 3 days
= 9 sprints

Next, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance covered in each sprint (60 meters) to get the total distance James runs in a week:

Total distance = Number of sprints * Distance per sprint
= 9 sprints * 60 meters
= 540 meters

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week."
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," First, let's find out how many students enrolled in each type of dance:

Contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = (20 * 0.2) / 100 = 4 students
Jazz dance: 25% of (remaining students) = (20 - 4) * 0.25 / 100 = 3.75 ≈ 4 students (since we can't have a fraction of a student)
Hip-hop dance: The rest = 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students

Now, to find the percentage of the entire group that enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," Firstly, we know that there were a total of 42 red apples + 7 green apples = <<42+7=49>>49 apples ordered.
Next, since only 9 students wanted fruit, this means that 9 students took all the apples.
Since each student got one apple (either red or green), regardless of the color, the number of apples taken is still just 9.
Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with no extra apples; they have exactly as many apples left as they started with, which was 49 - 9 = <<49-9=40>>40 apples."
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," 1. First, let's add up all the carrots they picked: 29 (Carol) + 16 (Mom) = 45 carrots in total.
2. Now we know that only 38 of these carrots are good. So to find out how many bad carrots there are, we subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 45 - 38 = 7.

The final answer is that there are 7 bad carrots."
6,SVAMP,Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total. If white t-shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages. How many white t-shirts does each package have?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," We know that mom bought a total of 70 white t-shirts. She also bought 14 packages. To find out how many white t-shirts are in each package, we need to divide the total number of white t-shirts (70) by the number of packages (14).

So, 70 divided by 14 equals...

5.0000000000000006

Since it's not possible for a package to contain a fractional number of white t-shirts, there must be an error in our calculation or information provided. It is likely that the actual number of white t-shirts per package may vary depending on the specific purchase details."
7,SVAMP,Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," First, let's calculate the area of one room:
Area of one room = Length * Width
= 19 ft * 18 ft
= 342 sq ft

Next, we multiply this value by the total number of rooms (20) to find out how much carpet is needed for all rooms:
Total carpet area = Area of one room * Number of rooms
= 342 sq ft * 20
= 6840 sq ft

So, Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms."
8,AddSub,There were 28 bales of hay in the barn. Tim stacked bales in the barn today. There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," Here's how you can solve this problem logically:

1. We start with 28 bales of hay in the barn.
2. Today, Tim added more bales to the barn.
3. Now there are 54 bales of hay in the barn.
4. To find out how many bales Tim added, we subtract the initial number of bales from the current number of bales: 54 - 28 = 26.

So, Tim stored 26 new bales of hay in the barn."
9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," We start with 6 roses in the vase. Then, Mary cuts some roses from her flower garden and adds them to the vase. Now there are 16 roses in the vase.

The difference between the number of roses in the vase before Mary cut any (6) and after she cut all of them (16) is equal to the number of roses she cut. So we subtract 6 from 16:

Number of roses cut = 16 - 6 = 10

So, Mary cut 10 roses."
10,SingleEq,"After eating at the restaurant, Sally, Sam, and Alyssa decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid 45 dollars, what was the total of the bill?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," We know that if each person pays $45, then the total bill must be divisible by 3 (since there are three people). Also, we can assume that the bill is greater than zero since it represents a real-world scenario where someone has spent money on food. Therefore, let's start with a multiple of 3 for our guess:

Guess: The total bill is $135.

Now, let's check if this guess works out when divided equally among the three friends:
$135 / 3 = $45

Since our guess ($135) divided evenly into thirds ($45), it means that our initial guess was correct! So, the total bill was indeed $135."
11,SingleEq,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe wants 8 cups of flour. She already put in 2 cups. How many more cups does she need to add?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," 1. We know that the recipe calls for 8 cups of flour.
2. Mary has already added 2 cups, so we subtract those from the total amount needed: 
   
   Total Flour Needed = Recipe Calls For - Already Added
   = 8 cups - 2 cups
   = 6 cups

3. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."

14,StrategyQA,Does the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exist?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," The question asks about a specific year, which is important because countries and their names can change over time. In this case, we need to find out what country won the most gold medals in 1976.

According to official Olympic records, the United States of America won the most gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, Canada. They had a total of 52 gold medals, followed closely behind by the Soviet Union with 48 golds.

As of my knowledge up to 2021, both the United States and the Soviet Union still exist as sovereign nations. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, the countries that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exist."
15,StrategyQA,Is the Mona Lisa in the same museum as the Venus de Milo?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," 1. The Mona Lisa is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, while the Venus de Milo is an ancient Greek sculpture of Aphrodite.
2. Both works are considered masterpieces and are highly famous.
3. However, they belong to different time periods (the Renaissance for the Mona Lisa and Ancient Greece for the Venus de Milo).
4. Furthermore, these pieces were created by different artists with different techniques.
5. Despite their fame, there isn't any information suggesting that the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo are in the same museum. In fact, they are usually displayed in separate galleries or rooms within museums dedicated to art history."
16,Last Letters,"'Take the last letters of each words in ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"" and concatenate them'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," Sure, let's break it down! Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Identify the words in the given sentence: ""Lino Mariel Aditya Elisabeth"".
2. Take the last letter of each word: L-o, M-e, A-d, I-t, Y-a, E-l, S-i, B-e, T-h.
3. Concatenate (combine) these letters in alphabetical order: ADITYAEISBETHOLOME.

So the answer is ""ADITYAEISBETHOLOME""."
17,Last Letters,"'Take the last letters of each words in ""Jacky Socorro Mark Wanda"" and concatenate them'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," Sure, let me break it down for you:

1. The first word is ""Jacky"".
2. The last letter of ""Jacky"" is ""y"".
3. The second word is ""Socorro"".
4. The last letter of ""Socorro"" is ""o"".
5. The third word is ""Mark"".
6. The last letter of ""Mark"" is ""k"".
7. The fourth word is ""Wanda"".
8. The last letter of ""Wanda"" is ""a"".
9. To find the final answer, we need to concatenate all these letters together. So, y + o + k + a = ""yoak""."
18,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Walter does not flip the coin. Mikayla does not flip the coin. Larry does not flip the coin. Ryan does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse"".'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," 1. The question states that a coin is initially heads up. This means that if we were to look at the coin, it would be facing us with one side showing heads and the other showing tails.
2. Then, we are told that none of these people (Walter, Mikayla, Larry, or Ryan) flip the coin. Flipping in this context refers to turning over the coin so that the opposite side faces upwards.
3. Since no one flips the coin, it remains in its original position with heads facing upwards. Therefore, yes, the coin is still heads up after all these individuals do not flip it."
19,Coin Flip,"'A coin is heads up. Lorena does not flip the coin. Shana does not flip the coin. Priscilla does not flip the coin. Summer does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up? Note that ""flip"" here means ""reverse""'",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,Zero-shot-CoT," 1. The question states that a coin is initially heads up, but it doesn't specify who flipped it or how long ago it was flipped. So we can assume that the coin has been heads up for some time before the events described in the question began.
2. Lorena, Shana, Priscilla, and Summer do not flip the coin. This means they don't reverse its orientation, so the coin remains heads up as far as we know.
3. However, since none of these individuals have flipped the coin, there could be other factors at play that might change its orientation. For example, someone else could have flipped the coin, or an external force like wind or gravity could cause it to rotate and land on a different side.
4. Without more information about what happened after the initial statement, we cannot definitively say whether the coin is still heads up or not."

We are given that the total number of working days in the fortnight is 15.
The average wage for the entire fortnight is $90 per day.
The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day, and the average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day.

Let's denote the wage earned on the 8th day as x. We can use this information to create an equation:

x + ($87 \* 6) / 7 = $90

Solving for x:

$87 \* 6 = $462

$462 / 7 = $65.86

Subtracting $65.86 from $90 gives us:

$24.14 - $65.86 = -$41.72

This result doesn't make sense because it indicates that the worker earned less than nothing on the 8th day. Therefore, we made an error somewhere. 

Let's reconsider our approach. Instead of using the average wage for the entire fortnight, we should use the weighted average wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days separately. This will give us more accurate information about the worker's earnings on each day.

Weighted Average Wage for First 7 Days:

($87 \* 7) / 7 = $561

Weighted Average Wage for Last 7 Days:

($92 \* 7) / 7 = $644

Total Earnings for Fortnight:

$561 + $644 = $1205

Now, we know that the total earnings for the fortnight were $1205. To find out how much the worker earned on the 8th day, we need to subtract the total earnings for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total earnings for the fortnight:

$1205 - ($561 + $644) = $100

Therefore, the worker earned $100 on the 8th day."
1,AQuA,"If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," Plan:

We are given that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents.
Let's assume that each bottle costs x cents.
Therefore, 27 bottles would cost 27x cents.
Now we need to convert this value from cents to dollars.
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide the total amount by 100 to get the equivalent value in dollars.
So, 27x = 27x/100 = 0.27x dollars.

Therefore, the answer is:
(A) AB/2700 = (A)(0.27x)/2700 = 0.0098x/2700 = 0.0036x/1000 = 0.0036x cents/dollar or $0.0036x/1000 dollars.

Final answer: The cost of B bottles in dollars is (A) AB/2700."
2,GSM8K,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," Understanding the Problem:

James wants to run 3 sprints of 60 meters each, 3 times a week.

So, in one session, he will run:

Sprints per Session = Sprints per Week / Days per Week
= 3 / 3
= 1 sprint

Therefore, in one session, he will run 60 meters.

Plan:

To find out how much distance James covers in a week, we need to multiply his weekly sprint distance by the number of sessions he has per week.

Distance Covered in a Week = Distance per Session * Sessions per Week
= 60 meters * 3 sessions/week
= 180 meters

Calculation:

We know that James runs 60 meters per sprint and has 3 sessions per week. Therefore, the total distance covered in a week is:

Total Distance = Number of Sprints x Distance per Sprint x Sessions per Week
= 3 x 60 x 3
= 540 meters

Final Answer:

James covers a total of 540 meters in a week."
3,GSM8K,"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," Firstly, we need to find out how many students are enrolled in each type of dance. We know that there are 20 students in total. 

Contemporary Dance: 20% of 20 = 4 students 
Jazz Dance: 25% of (20 - 4) = 10 students 
Hip Hop Dance: The rest is 20 - 4 - 10 = 6 students 

Now, we want to find out what percentage of the entire group of 20 students enrolled in Hip Hop Dance. To do this, we divide the number of students who enrolled in Hip Hop Dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. 

Percentage of Hip Hop Dance Enrollment = (Number of Students in Hip Hop Dance / Total Number of Students) x 100 
Percentage of Hip Hop Dance Enrollment = (6 / 20) x 100 
Percentage of Hip Hop Dance Enrollment = 30% 

Therefore, 30% of the entire group of 20 students enrolled in Hip Hop Dance."
4,MultiArith,"The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," Firstly, we need to know how many total apples were ordered. We are given that there were 42 red apples and 7 green apples, so there must be a total of 42 + 7 = <<42+7=49>>49 apples.

Next, we need to figure out how many apples would have been eaten by the 9 students who wanted them. Since each student gets one apple, this means that 9 x 1 = <<9*1=9>>9 apples were consumed.

Now, subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples ordered:

49 - 9 = <<49-9=40>>40 apples

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with an extra 40 - 49 = <<40-49=-9>>-9 apples. However, since it's not possible to have negative apples, we made an error in our initial assumption about the number of students wanting fruit. It seems like more than 9 students actually wanted fruit, causing the excess apples."
5,MultiArith,"Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?",Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The problem states that Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16 carrots. However, we know that only 38 of these carrots are good. Therefore, there must be some bad carrots among them.

Let's denote the number of bad carrots as x. We can use algebraic reasoning to set up an equation:

Total Carrots = Good Carrots + Bad Carrots

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

45 = 38 + x

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

7 = x

Therefore, Carol and her mother had 7 bad carrots in total."
6,SVAMP,Mom buys 70 white t-shirts in total. If white t-shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages. How many white t-shirts does each package have?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," Plan:

1. Extract the total number of white t-shirts from the question.
2. Determine how many packages were bought.
3. Calculate the number of white t-shirts per package.

Step 1: Total White T-Shirts
Total White T-Shirts = 70

Step 2: Number of Packages
Number of Packages = 14

Step 3: White T-Shirts Per Package
White T-Shirts Per Package = Total White T-Shirts / Number of Packages
White T-Shirts Per Package = 70 / 14
White T-Shirts Per Package = 5

Therefore, each package has 5 white t-shirts."
7,SVAMP,Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The problem states that Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. She has 20 rooms in total. We need to find out how much carpet is needed to cover the floor of all these rooms.

Let's start with calculating the area of one room:
Area of one room = Length x Width
= 19 ft x 18 ft
= 342 sq ft

Since there are 20 rooms in total, we can multiply this value by 20 to get the total area required for all rooms:
Total area required = Area of one room x Number of rooms
= 342 sq ft x 20
= 6840 sq ft

Therefore, Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms."
8,AddSub,There were 28 bales of hay in the barn. Tim stacked bales in the barn today. There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The initial number of bales is 28. After storing some more, there are now 54 bales in total. We need to find out how many bales were added to get from 28 to 54. 

Let's denote the number of additional bales as x. Therefore, we can write:

Initial Number + Additional Bales = Final Number
28 + x = 54

Now, we will solve for x:

x = 54 - 28
x = 26

Therefore, Tim stored 26 bales of hay in the barn.

Final Answer: Tim stored 26 bales of hay in the barn."
9,AddSub,There were 6 roses in the vase. Mary cut some roses from her flower garden. There are now 16 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The initial number of roses in the vase is 6. After cutting some roses, there are now 16 roses in the vase. We need to find out how many roses Mary cut.

Let's denote the number of roses that Mary cut as x. 

We can set up an equation based on this information:

Initial Number of Roses + Cut Roses = Final Number of Roses

6 + x = 16

Now we can solve for x:

x = 16 - 6

x = 10

Therefore, Mary cut 10 roses from her flower garden."

Each person paid $45 towards the bill. We need to find the total amount of the bill.

Let's denote the total amount of the bill as x. Since each person paid an equal share of the bill, we can write:

x = 45 * 3

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = 135

Therefore, the total amount of the bill was $135."

Here are some possible answers based on this information:

1. A school bus - It's unlikely that a school bus would require a fire extinguisher since they typically do not have any flammable materials or electrical equipment inside.
2. A boat - Boats don't usually have anything that could catch fire, so having an extinguisher might be unnecessary.
3. A house - While houses can contain flammable materials like wood, most homes also have smoke detectors and sprinkler systems in case of a fire emergency.
4. A hospital - Hospitals have strict safety regulations and protocols in place to prevent fires, including fire suppression systems and trained staff.
5. A school - Schools often have multiple fire extinguishers strategically placed throughout the building to put out small fires quickly.

Therefore, the best answer choice would be E) School."
14,StrategyQA,Does the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exist?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The question asks about the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics. We need to find out which country won the most gold medals in the year 1976. To do this, we can use an online source or reference material such as the official website of the Olympic Games or any other reliable source.

Once we have identified the country with the highest number of gold medals in 1976, we can check if it still exists today. This is where our knowledge of geography and history comes into play. If the country no longer exists, then we cannot say whether it still exists or not.

Let's assume that the country with the most gold medals in 1976 was the United States. According to the official website of the Olympic Games, the United States won a total of 280 medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, including 104 gold medals. Therefore, the United States would be the country with the most gold medals in 1976.

Now, let's check if the United States still exists today. Yes, the United States still exists today. It is one of the largest countries in the world and has been around for over two centuries. Therefore, we can conclude that the country that received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics still exists today."
15,StrategyQA,Is the Mona Lisa in the same museum as the Venus de Milo?,Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,PS+," The question asks if the Mona Lisa is in the same museum as the Venus de Milo. 

Let's assume that we have two variables: ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Venus de Milo"". We don't know which museum they are both located in, so we can represent this variable with another variable called ""museum"". Therefore, our equation would be:

Mona Lisa = Museum
Venus de Milo = Museum

Since we want to find out if the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo are in the same museum, we need to compare these two equations. If they are equal, then the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo are in the same museum. However, without more information about the specific museum or its location, it is impossible to determine whether the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo are indeed in the same museum."
