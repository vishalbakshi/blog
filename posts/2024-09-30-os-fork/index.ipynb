Fork and its variants are typically the only way of doing so in Unix-like systems. For a process to start the execution of a different program, it first forks to create a copy of itself. Then, the copy, called the \"child process\", calls the exec system call to overlay itself with the other program: it ceases execution of its former program in favor of the other."

For instance, executing `pid = os.fork` in a notebook cell causes the execution to hang when trying to return the child's process ID, or spawns multiple child processes when using the `if os_fork:/else:` pattern.\n",
