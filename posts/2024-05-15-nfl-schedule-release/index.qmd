## Background

The NFL schedule got released today! My mood has instantly improved. Fall is my favorite season in general, and watching football is one of my purest joys (and purest stressors). In this blog post I'll write down my thoughts and predictions after a few minutes of looking at the 2024 Philadelphia Eagles' schedule.

## Initial Reaction: I really like it.

At first glance, I think this is a great schedule. It's tied for the 10th-easiest schedule in the league. The longest stretch against teams with 2023 winning records is three weeks (at Cincy, Jax, at Dallas). The only other such stretches are two weeks long (at NO, at TB---revenge match; at LAR, at BAL).

## Prediction: 12-5

The toughest matches outside the division are against the AFC North. I would be happy if we went 2-2 against them. I think Eagles beat Cincy and Cleveland and lose to the Ravens and Steelers.

Division matchups are always tricky but with Kellen Moore's offensive scheme (which hopefully takes advantage of checkdowns, quick throws and the middle of the field) I think the Eagles won't stumble against the Giants. Washington is always a weird matchup, they always seem to play really well against the Eagles (at least the last few years) so I think we split against them. Same for Dallas. International games are always weird with jet lag playing a factor, so I think Eagles lose to Green Bay in Brazil. That means the Eagles end up 4-4 against 2023 playoff teams. 

## Success = At Least Two Playoff Wins

As has been the case the last two seasons, I feel that a successful season would result in at least two playoff wins. If we get the 1 seed, that means making it to the Super Bowl, otherwise at least making it to the NFCCG.

Go Birds!
