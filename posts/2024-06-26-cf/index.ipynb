In our framework, this model leverages past implicit engagement data of learners (i.e., course watches) to identify relevant courses. _We learn a latent representation for each learner and each course and use similarities between these latent representations to predict member-course relevance_.\n",

For example, after swiping on a few profiles:\n",

In this fascinating work, they draw analogies between recommending products based on sparse user preference data (users don't provide explicit feedback often) and predicting blanks in sparse sensor data (failed readings due to malfunction, extreme weather, network quality and other reasons) as both involve a correlation between the subject of interest (users or sensors):\n",
        "\n",
        "> The key idea of our proposal is that, fortunately, sensor array results are not completely independent from each other; e.g., readings from sensors under high environmental temperature in some area in China can help to predict readings of some other sensors that have reported failures in a high temperature area from Nevada; it can be done when a correlation in the sensor values of both areas occurs. This is precisely what CF RS are trained for: they predict item’s values that the users have not voted yet based on the rating values of the rest of the RS users.\n",
        "\n",
        "They use PMF (Probabilistic Matrix Factorization) which, based on my understanding of their explanation, seems very similar (if not exactly the same) as the latent factor and dot-product prediction approach used in Chapter 8 of the fastai textbook----in short, you generate random embeddings (or tensors) of size U (users) x N (latent factors) for users and I (items) x N (latent factors) for the items (like movies, songs, or products) and take the dot product of U and I to get the predicted ratings (or preference scores). Using gradient descent to minimize Root Mean Squared Error as a loss function, the model learns these latent factors and gets better at predicting a rating of an item by a user who has not explicitly rated the item (i.e. it gets better at predicting blank ratings).\n",
