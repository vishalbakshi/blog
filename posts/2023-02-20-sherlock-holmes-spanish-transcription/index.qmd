## Background 
I have watched all four seasons of BBC's [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)) probably 5 times. I learn something new about it each time. 

I have tried to learn Spanish using Duolingo, stopping and re-starting every year or so, without much success. 

I don't really recall how the thought came about but I decided to combine my love of the show with my desire to learn Spanish into one project---this one!

## Setup

Using the embedded Google Translate UI and my partner's translator-level knowledge of the language, I am transcribing every word of the show into Spanish. 

![A screenshot of my translation setup: Google Translate embedded underneath the search bar---the result of googling "Google Translate". I've typed "Sherlock Holmes" in the "English" textbox on the left and it has translated to "Sherlock Holmes" in the Spanish output on the right.](google_translate_1.png)

In a second tab, I have the show open (with subtitles on).

I transcribe in a `.txt` file titled `transcript.txt`, documenting the following fields:

- `season` number
- `episode` number
- `time`stamp (hours::minutes:seconds)
- who is the `speaker`?
- the `english` transcription of what they say
- the `spanish` translation of that
- `notes` which usually documents specific word translations

As an example, the first bit of dialogue in the series is John Watson's therapist Ella asking him "How's your blog going?" which translates to "Cómo va tu blog?" Where `va` = `goes`. 

How goes your blog? 
I would say quite well heheheh.

```xml
season,episode,time,speaker,english,spanish,notes
1,1,00:01:30,ella,how's your blog going?,cómo va tu blog?, va = goes
```
## What I'm Learning

I'll write in this blog post some examples of the translations and how I'm thinking through the process, as well as what I'm learning from discussions with my partner. 

Three main themes I'm seeing so far about translating from English to Spanish:

- which words to use depends a lot on context.
- words that sound the same but mean different things will sometimes have different emphasis.
- a word that is technically correct may not be used frequently in conversation.

I'm not quite sure how to best document what I'm learning so I'll just start writing.

### Ella: "You haven't written a word, have you?"

Something I enjoy doing is translating the Spanish back into English without changing word positions. The benefit of this exercise of translating and translating back is that it reveals (or focuses my attention on) nuances I wouldn't otherwise be aware of. 

English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_You haven't written a word, have you?_</span>

Spanish: <span style="color:#006A85;">_No has escrito una palabra verdad?_</span>

Back to English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_Not you have written a word true?_</span>

I asked my partner how she would translate it and she said: <span style="color:#006A85;">_No has escrito **ni** una palabra, verdad?_</span>

Which translates to: <span style="color:#85005B;">_You haven't written **not even** a word, true?_</span>

It bothers me that I don't know why in English the question ends in <span style="color:#85005B;">_have you?_</span> but in Spanish it ends with <span style="color:#006A85;">_true?_</span>. Of course this may just be how Spanish works or how conversational Spanish works. 

I asked my partner how you would say just <span style="color:#85005B;">_have you?_</span> in Spanish and it's <span style="color:#006A85;">_lo has?_</span>

Google Translate aligns with this when it translates from Spanish to English:

Spanish: <span style="color:#006A85;">_No has escrito ni una palabra **lo has**?_</span>

English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_You haven't written a word, have you?_</span>

But recommends ending with <span style="color:#006A85;">_verdad?_</span> when I translate from English to Spanish.

### Speaker: "You can share mine"

Here are the Google Translate forward and backward translations:

<br>

English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_You can share mine_.</span>

Spanish: <span style="color:#006A85;">_Puedes compartir el mio_.</span>

<br>

Spanish: <span style="color:#006A85;">_Puedes compartir el mio_.</span>

English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_**Can you** share mine_.</span>

<br>

However, if I start the Spanish translation with <span style="color:#006A85;">_**tu**_</span> the English translation matches my original prompt:

<br>

Spanish: <span style="color:#006A85;">_**Tu** puedes compartir el mio_.</span>

English: <span style="color:#85005B;">_You can share mine_.</span>

<br>

I think this is a good example of how what is technically correct may or may not be what's used in conversation---saying <span style="color:#006A85;">_**tu**_</span> may not be strictly required for conversation and may be implicitly understood because of the form used---<span style="color:#006A85;">_puedes_</span> (<span style="color:#85005B;">_you_ can</span>).

|Spanish|English|
|-|-|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">puedes</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">you can</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">puedo</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">I can</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">puedemos</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">we can</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pueden</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">they can</span>|

### Lestrade: "Well, they all took the same poison."

Something else I've enjoyed and learned from is watching how a translation changes as you type the full sentence in Google Translate.

For example when translating from Spanish (<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos tomaron el mismo veneno</span>) to English (<span style="color:#85005B;">well, they all took the same poison</span>):

|Spanish|English|
|-|-|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well, everyone</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos tomaron</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well, they all took</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos tomaron el</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well, everyone took</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos tomaron el mismo</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well, they all took the same</span>|
|<span style="color:#006A85;">pues, todos tomaron el mismo veneno</span>|<span style="color:#85005B;">well, they all took the same poison</span>|

What I'm observing might have less to do with how Spanish works and more to do with how Google Translate works. Although some words seem interchangeable (<span style="color:#006A85;">todos</span> seems to mean <span style="color:#85005B;">everyone</span> or <span style="color:#85005B;">they all</span>).
