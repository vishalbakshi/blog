    "It's been 5 years since I [last explored NFL's play-by-play data](https://vishalbakshi.github.io/posts/nfl_sql.html). It's also been 5 years since my Eagles won the Super Bowl, which will be played in less than 24 hours from now. <span style=\"color:#004C54;\"><strong><em>Go Birds</em></strong></span>. \n",

    "I have thoroughly enjoyed some of the statistical analyses put forth by fans of the NFL this year. My favorite analyst is [Deniz Selman](https://twitter.com/denizselman33?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), a fellow Eagles fan who makes [these beautiful data presentations](https://twitter.com/denizselman33/status/1620631738140733440?s=20&t=LKBn17kz9KHAbc5V-lXBjA). \n",

    "My second favorite analyst is [Ben Baldwin, AKA Computer Cowboy](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) especially his 4th down analysis realtime during games.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been an onslaught of statistical advances in the NFL since I last explored play-by-play data and I'm excited to learn as much as I can. In particular, I'd like to get a hang of the metrics EPA (Expected Points Added) and DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average), which may not necessarily intersect with my play-by-play analysis (I believe Football Outsiders is the proprietor of that formula).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd also like to use this project to practice more advanced SQL queries than I'm used to. Given the complexity of the play-by-play dataset (by team, down, field position, etc.) I'm hoping I can get those reps in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I'd like to explore data presentation with these statistics using R, python, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I've been inspired by simple, elegant graphics like those made by Peter Gorman in [Barely Maps](https://www.barelymaps.com/) and bold, picturesque statistics posted by PFF on twitter:\n",
