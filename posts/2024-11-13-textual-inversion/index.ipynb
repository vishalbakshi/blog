    "In Lesson 9 of the fastai course (Part 2) we are introduced to the concept of _textual inversion_, where you train an embedding on a new set of images the model hasn't seen before, and then use that embedding during inference to have the model adapt its style (or object) in the generated image. To get some experience with training and inference, I decided to train a textual inversion embeddings on six pencil/pen drawings I made of one of my favorite childhood cartoons: Samurai Jack."

    "The trained embeddings (with the associated token `<samurai-jack>`) have clearly learned features related to my original drawings. The generated images have similar clothing and weapons. However, at both 30 and 50 inference steps, the style of the generated images doesn't really resemble the style I drew the source drawings with (pencil/pen sketch). Additionally, the generated images have color, whereas my drawings were grayscale. I do like the generated images for the cat and mouse prompts. Finally, there's something stereotypical about the generated images which bothers me---it's almost like the model has detected that the trained embeddings represent japanese art and it has drawn upon whatever training data aligns with that."
