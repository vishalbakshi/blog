    "In this notebook, I'll summarize the paper [Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) by Bai et al (Anthropic). Here's the abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "> As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels. "

    "- You can train a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement (following a \"constitution\" of \"principles\") using human feedback labels for helpfulness and AI feedback labels for harmlessness.\n",

    "I thoroughly enjoyed reading, preparing, presenting and writing about this research paper. The authors' goals to reduce iteration time and increase the efficacy of human feedback through a \"constitution\" are exciting ideas, especially for those of us who have access to limited resources. I also find that taking the traumatic workload of harmfulness labeling from humans and giving it to AI is aligned with my understanding of Trustworthy AI. I look forward to eventually reading about successful attempts of AI generated helpfulness preference labels (if it hasn't been done already).\n",
