In the video, Jeremy referenced a series of walkthrough videos that he made while working through the four-notebook series for this competition. I'm excited to watch these walkthroughs to better understand how to approach a Kaggle competition from the perspective of a former #1 Kaggle grandmaster.\n","\n","In this blog post series, I'll walk through the code Jeremy shared in each of the 6 Live Coding videos focused on this competition, submitting predictions to Kaggle along the way.

It's a bit different to ImageNet, which is what most of our pretrained models are trained on. Nearly all of the images are the same shape and size in this competition. \n","\n","There are two key dimensions that really seem to impact how well a model can be fine-tuned:\n","- How similar is your dataset to the dataset used for the pretrained model? \n","  - If it's similar (like PETS to ImageNet), then the critical factor is how well does the fine-tuning of the model maintain the weights that are pretrained. They're probably not going to change very much. And you can take advantage of really big accurate models that have learned to do almost the exact same thing that you are trying to do.\n","  - If it's not similar (like Planets to ImageNet), a lot of the weights of a pretrained model are going to be useless for fine-tuning this because they'e learned specific features (like what does text look like, what do eyeballs look like, what does fur look like) none of which are going to be useful at all. \n","- How big is your dataset?\n","  - On a big dataset, you've got time and epochs to take advantage of having lots of parameters in the model to learn to use them effectively. If you don't have much data you don't have much ability to do that.\n","  \n","  \n","Jeremy and Thomas Capelle analyze which models are the best for fine-tuning and Jeremy published the results in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning). They used [YAML files](https://github.com/tcapelle/fastai_timm/blob/main/sweep_planets_lr.yaml) for Weights and Biases to define the different models and parameters that they wanted to test. You can use the wandb web GUI to view the training results.

They also have good error rate with low memory usage. The `swin` family, also a transformers-based model like `vit`, was the most accurate for fine-tuning the Planets dataset. For the Planets dataset, the really big slow models don't necessarily have better error rates. Which makes sense because if they have heaps of parameters but they're trying to learn something they've never seen before it's unlikely that we will be able to take advantage of those parameters.\n","\n","For some models (like vit_small_patch16_224) you can only use 224x224 image sizes, while with others (like convnext_tiny) you can use any sized images.\n","\n","Jeremy ran the vision model fine-tuning on 3 RTX GPUs for about 12 hours. They didn't try all combinations of all parameters. Thomas ran a learning rate sweep to get a sense of what learning rates work well, and then they tried a couple of learning rates, a couple of the best resize methods and a couple of the best pooling types across a few broadly different kinds of models across the two different datasets. In every single case, the same learning rate, resize method and pooling method was the best.

What you could do is halve the batch size, so for example from 64 to 32, and then only zero the gradients every two iterations, and only do the update every two iterations. So you calculate in two batches what you calculate in one batch and it will be mathematically identical, That's called `GradientAccumulation`, which added to the `Learner` as a callback, which are things that change the behavior of the training. \n","\n","How batches work: we randomly shuffle the dataset, and grab the next batch size of images, we resize them all to be the same size, and we stack them on top of each other.
