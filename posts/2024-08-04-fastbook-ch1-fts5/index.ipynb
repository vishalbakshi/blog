Theoretically, it is possible to approximate any mathematical function using two layers of artificial neurons. However, in practices, these networks were too big and too slow. While it was demonstrated that adding additional layers improved performance, this insight was not acknowledged, and the second AI winter began.

And indeed, neural networks were widely used during the '80s and '90s for real, practical projects. However, again a misunderstanding of the theoretical issues held back the field.

If a self-driving car doesn't know where a pedestrian is, then it doesn't know how to avoid one! Creating a model that can recognize the content of every individual pixel in an image is called *segmentation*. Here is how we can train a segmentation model with fastai, using a subset of the [*Camvid* dataset](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Brostow/papers/Brostow_2009-PRL.pdf) from the paper \\\"Semantic Object Classes in Video: A High-Definition Ground Truth Database\\\" by Gabruel J. Brostow, Julien Fauqueur, and Roberto Cipolla:\",\n          \"### How Our Image Recognizer Works\\n\\n```python\\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\\n    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,\\n    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))\\n```\",\n          \"### How Our Image Recognizer Works\\n\\n1. Use one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to get the new random head to work correctly with your dataset.\\n1. Use the number of epochs requested when calling the method to fit the entire model, updating the weights of the later layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers (which, as we'll see, generally don't require many changes from the pretrained weights).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fts5_result2_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"### End sidebar\\n\\nThis model is predicting movie ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5.0 to within around 0.6 average error. Since we're predicting a continuous number, rather than a category, we have to tell fastai what range our target has, using the `y_range` parameter.\",\n          \"## Validation Sets and Test Sets\\n\\nHaving two levels of \\\"reserved data\\\"\\u2014a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself\\u2014may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we *always* need a separate test set\\u2014if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set\\u2014but generally it's best to use one if at all possible.\",\n          \"## Your First Model\\n\\nAs we said before, we will teach you how to do things before we explain why they work. Following this top-down approach, we will begin by actually training an image classifier to recognize dogs and cats with almost 100% accuracy. To train this model and run our experiments, you will need to do some initial setup.

This ensures that the model performance is not due to “cheating” or memorization of the dataset, but rather because it learns the appropriate features to use for prediction. However, it is possible that we overfit the validation data as well. This is because the human modeler is also part of the training process, adjusting hyperparameters (see question 32 for definition) and training procedures according to the validation performance. Therefore, another unseen portion of the dataset, the test set, is used for final evaluation of the model.

Right?\\n## Validation Sets and Test Sets\\n\\nIn fact, not necessarily. The situation is more subtle. This is because in realistic scenarios we rarely build a model just by training its weight parameters once. Instead, we are likely to explore many versions of a model through various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors we will discuss in upcoming chapters. Many of these choices can be described as choices of *hyperparameters*.

A `Transform` contains code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined `Transform`s, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds: `item_tfms` are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square), while `batch_tfms` are applied to a *batch* of items at a time using the GPU, so they're particularly fast (we'll see many examples of these throughout this book).\\n### How Our Image Recognizer Works\\n\\nWhy 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase the size, you'll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is true if you decrease the size.\\n### How Our Image Recognizer Works\\n\\n&gt; Note: Classification and Regression: _classification_ and _regression_ have very specific meanings in machine learning. These are the two main types of model that we will be investigating in this book. A classification model is one which attempts to predict a class, or category. That is, it's predicting from a number of discrete possibilities, such as \"dog\" or \"cat.\" A regression model is one which attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as a temperature or a location. Sometimes people use the word _regression_ to refer to a particular kind of model called a _linear regression model_; this is a bad practice, and we won't be using that terminology in this book!</td>\n",

Even more importantly, he worked on building the first device that actually used these principles, the Mark I Perceptron. In \"The Design of an Intelligent Automaton\" Rosenblatt wrote about this work: \"We are now about to witness the birth of such a machine–-a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any human training or control.\" The perceptron was built, and was able to successfully recognize simple shapes.\\n## Neural Networks: A Brief History\\n\\nAn MIT professor named Marvin Minsky (who was a grade behind Rosenblatt at the same high school!), along with Seymour Papert, wrote a book called _Perceptrons_ (MIT Press), about Rosenblatt's invention. They showed that a single layer of these devices was unable to learn some simple but critical mathematical functions (such as XOR). In the same book, they also showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow these limitations to be addressed. Unfortunately, only the first of these insights was widely recognized. As a result, the global academic community nearly entirely gave up on neural networks for the next two decades.\\n## Neural Networks: A Brief History\\n\\nPerhaps the most pivotal work in neural networks in the last 50 years was the multi-volume *Parallel Distributed Processing* (PDP) by David Rumelhart, James McClellan, and the PDP Research Group, released in 1986 by MIT Press.
