I wonder if that's because $A_0$ is initialized as a normal (Gaussian) matrix and since it's a rank-stable adapter, it doesn't deviate that much from that normal distribution? Again, not sure. Additionally, in their $B_n$ expression they multiply by $A_0^T$ instead of the $A_n^T$ term in the gradient---maybe an indication that $A_n$ doesn't deviate much from $A_0$? Not sure."
