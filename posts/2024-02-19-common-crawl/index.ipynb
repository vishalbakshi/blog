        "CC data is primarily used for pre-training a model, meaning when an architecture is fed data in order to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens. During this phase, we expect the model to store patterns or associations between words in a language (like English) in the sense that given an English word or subword, it can predict the next word or subword that in a grammatically sensible way. For example, if the model is prompted \"the bird is\" after being pre-trained on sensible data it will likely predict the next word to be \"red\" or \"hungry\" or something sensible. This is contrasted with _fine-tuning_ where a model that can generally predict the next token sensibly is then trained on domain-specific data to predict the next token of a particular domain (such as ornithology, the study of birds). So, if a model fine-tuned on ornithological data is prompted \"a group of ravens is called\" it will hopefully predict the next word as \"unkindness.\"\n",

I would go further and say that there is no such thing as neutral data, even raw data is not neutral because data collection, and the environment within which data is collected is not neutral.\n",

Since a URL's quality is determined by its Harmonic Centrality Score, and since that score is determined by how accessible the URL is to other URLs, URLs from communities without socioeconomic power and/or resources will not be deemed \"accessible\" as such and will be scored low. Additionally, many communities will post popular links to Facebook, but because it doesn't allow crawlers, CC won't get to see that URL.\n",
